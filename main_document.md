## I. Overview

While verification in previous arms control agreements between the United States and Russia has
focused largely on delivery systems, future agreements may seek to focus on the verification of
limits on the warheads themselves, requiring innovative verification tools and protocols. In May,
2022, CNS published Occasional Paper #55 entitled Everything Counts: Building a Control
Regime for Nonstrategic Nuclear Warheads in Europe, which put forward, inter alia, the concept
of a warhead tracking system (WTS) using cryptographic identifiers and warhead logistics data
from existing inventory management systems. A demonstration of the associated warhead
verification approach took place in December 2022. Since then, CNS has advanced the WTS
concept with the expectation that a data exchange methodology, including a system for data
challenges and warhead notifications using cryptologically generated warhead unique identifiers,
can provide a foundation from which to build a comprehensive verification protocol addressing
nuclear warheads.

This paper presents a menu of verification methods, technologies, and measures that may be used
to design a verification protocol for any type of warhead stockpile agreement ranging from:
promoting transparency of overall stockpile levels: to introducing initial confidence building
measures through the exchange of warhead stockpile data; to enabling notifications of warhead
movements as a risk reduction measure; or to a formal arms control treaty that might cap or
require reductions in the warhead inventory. The goal is to provide a variety of technologies and
verification measures to maximize confidence in any agreed warhead data exchanges while
minimizing on-site inspection requirements. The menu identifies specific verification measures
and technologies that work together to provide the highest possible confidence level in the data
and declarations issued by the inspected party. These measures and technologies have also been
carefully selected to minimize the level of intrusiveness they may require.

All the measures identified in the menu have been carefully designed to minimize safety and
security concerns as well as potential vulnerabilities from exposing warhead data involving
design, composition, or performance. The menu includes on-site measures that range from a
level of mild intrusiveness to highly intrusive techniques that could be used if the sides were to
insist and agree upon on-site observation and exchange of warhead-related data obtained through
on-site measures. While the on-site measures identified in our menus for the most part focus on
collecting data from equipment used to handle or secure warheads, we also offer some optional
measures that could be used to verify the presence or absence of warheads in certain containers,
transportation systems, or storage locations, though these measures would all be considered
highly intrusive on our spectrum of intrusiveness.

In defining “intrusiveness” within our assessment, we considered a variety of factors including,
but not limited to: a.) physical presence of inspectors with the degree of intrusiveness increasing
from being in the country, to traveling to a base, or to the most intrusive, permitting inspectors
direct access to a warhead; b.) sensitivity and vulnerability of the collected data; c.) cost to the
host country; and, d.) the complexity of the technology. The degree of intrusiveness also depends
on several factors in designing and implementing the overall systems to be used in monitoring


warhead transport and handling systems: how much data are collected; whether the data are
collected in real time or collected at designated intervals of time; and how the data are collected

- on site by the inspection team, by representatives of the host country as observed by the
inspection team in real time, or by the host country at designated intervals. Intrusiveness would
also depend on where the data are collected – for example, at a designated neutral site, at a
declared parking area, or at specific locations along a route. Finally, intrusiveness could be
mitigated if the data are collected and conveyed via a hash code or shared openly. Annex A
provides an assessment of the intrusiveness of the measures and technologies in our menu.

In addition, our menu identifies arms control precedents related to each verification measure. For
this part of our analysis, we included formal arms control agreements, joint experiments and
exercises, and US-Russian military-to-military and Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR)
engagements. These precedents also include a thorough review of current and former verification
research and development (R&D) programs conducted by the Department of Energy
(DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the national labs, Department of
Defense (DoD)/Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the State Department, as well as
international R&D programs, including those supported by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the International Partnership for Nuclear Disarmament Verification (IPNDV),
and previous joint R&D programs conducted between the US and Russia.

No verification will be 100 percent effective against all potential cheating. The goal of a
verification system is to create a high probability of detecting a significant violation. This has
been the US approach since the 1970s. An attempt to imagine every theoretically possible way to
commit a small violation and detect it with high probability would be immensely difficult to
negotiate and even more difficult to implement. The key finding in this study is that it is possible
to design a combination of measures to provide high confidence in the validity of data exchanges
on warhead stockpiles without requiring a high level of intrusiveness and with minimal on-site
requirements. A secondary finding is that by using the WTS methodology, relatively simple and
inexpensive technologies could be used to achieve high verification confidence. These
technologies would only require limited R&D to enhance their tamper protection and to
determine how best to apply them to the requisite warhead handling and support equipment.

## II. Warhead Operations in a “Closed System”

Nuclear warheads exist within a closed system – they are strictly accounted for, can be located
only at certain facilities, and can only be transported subject to strict rules. The closed nature of
that system creates an opportunity for accounting and verification. Warhead passports and the
Warhead Tracking System (WTS), designed and demonstrated by CNS to a senior audience of
arms control experts in December 2022,^1 leverage the closed nature of the nuclear enterprise and
provide a foundation for this menu of verification measures.

(^1) Marshall L. Brown, Jr., “Demonstrating a Warhead Tracking System,” James Martin Center for Nonproliferation
Studies, March, 2023, https://nonproliferation.org/demonstrating-a-warhead-tracking-system/.


There is a strong precedent for building accounting and verification around the principle of a
closed system. Namely, mobile ICBMs and their launchers are allowed to be located or moved
only between facilities designated in the START I Treaty’s Memorandum of Understanding.
With certain specified exceptions a mobile ICBM or its launcher outside such facilities would
constitute a violation. Similarly, the missile enters accounting at the moment it leaves the
production facility and exits it when the missile is sent to the elimination or dismantlement
facility. This proposed approach builds on the same principle but takes into account the more
closed operational system for nuclear warheads and incorporates significantly stricter verification
measures.

Warhead passports are virtual unique identifiers that use logistical life cycle data of individual
warheads within the WTS to account for warhead data. The menu of arms control verification
measures presented in this paper integrates warhead passports and the WTS system to provide a
comprehensive warhead verification approach that can support a potential future agreement or
risk reduction measure addressing warhead stockpiles.

To fully understand the rationale behind the proposed approach, a brief review of the operational
system of a nuclear warhead stockpile, including the equipment, personnel, logistics, and
facilities is appropriate. Since the primary interest of the United States is accounting for the
Russian stockpile, the main focus of our study was the Russian system of handling nuclear
weapons. We sought, however, to match the proposed regime to US practices to facilitate its
implementation in a relevant international regime.

The key characteristic of the warhead operational system is that every element of the system is
dedicated specifically to support nuclear warhead safety, security, and operations, and that all
warhead transportation and handling equipment are secured within this system. We know this is
true for the US and Russia based on military exchanges and nuclear security cooperation under
the CTR program. To the best of our knowledge and research conducted thus far, we believe this
is also true for China.

The warhead operational system consists of elements including, but not restricted to warheads
and their components; containers; lifting and handling gear such as cranes and forklifts;
transportation and moving systems such as gurneys, trucks, railcars, helicopters, and aircraft;
temporary and permanent storage facilities; and related security systems. For the purposes of this
study, we focused on assembled warheads in the US and Russian inventories. Warheads that are
installed on operationally deployed strategic delivery systems are not directly addressed by the
verification measures described in this study because verification procedures are already
contained in the New START treaty, but the measures proposed by CNS are flexible and could
be extended to these deployed warheads as well.

The first step in the warhead verification regime we propose begins with the transfer of custody
of an assembled device from the respective production facility to the Russian Ministry of
Defense or US Department of Defense, and that regime continues until the transfer of warheads
to the operational nuclear forces in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Strategic Rocket Forces, then
to the return of warhead from deployed to non-deployed status, and ending with the transfer of


the warhead to a disassembly facility. If a warhead is re-manufactured and re-assembled, it
would be accounted for as a new warhead once it is turned over to the respective Ministry of
Defense or Department of Defense.

Every piece of equipment that supports warheads in each country’s warhead operational system
is dedicated, certified, and continuously protected within secure facilities and storage sites. All
handling and transportation functions are conducted under strict, pre-planned procedures within
the overall warhead operational system. New equipment must be thoroughly checked and
certified to meet warhead handling standards before it can be introduced into the system, where it
is secured, tracked, and accounted for during its entire service life. During CTR nuclear security
cooperation, all equipment was x-rayed, and all software was examined for bugs and backdoors
before being deployed to operational sites. All warhead logistics require dedicated, certified, and
secure handling and transportation systems, including cranes; forklifts; gurneys; and associated
handling and lifting gear; cargo trucks, cargo railcars, and guard force railcars. While air
transportation systems may conduct dual-use operations, when they are used to ship warheads,
they are examined and certified for nuclear warhead operations as well. Even when all this
support equipment is not in use, it is secured within the closed warhead operational system.

Through previous experience with the CTR nuclear security cooperation program, we also know
that each side monitors and tracks the location, status, and usage of all support equipment,
transportation systems, as well as the identification of personnel, within this closed system, using
dedicated inventory control and management systems. Through technical exchanges with China
on the Nuclear Security Training Center conducted by DOE, we also know that China has a
robust inventory management and accounting system. Thus, all this data regarding systems
within the closed warhead system is already being collected on a continuous basis and
maintained at least for the duration of the life cycle of the individual warheads and support
equipment, and thus can be relevant in developing verification measures for a future agreement
addressing warheads.

Within this closed system, all warhead movements and transportation routes must be pre-
planned, approved, and secured. All storage locations, even temporary stops between locations,
are approved and continuously secured. While it may seem that warheads may be located
anywhere within a country or in the world, because the locations and routes cover such large
areas, if one considers that security concerns do not permit warhead movements to make
unplanned or unsanctioned stops along the transportation routes the closed system is not as
expansive as it might appear. In fact, under a future negotiated agreement, the closed systems can
be defined, declared, and “mapped” to define their boundaries for purposes of the agreement and
its verification mechanism.

In Figure 1 below, a representative map shows the areas in blue associated with all Russian
warhead storage sites and the facilities where warheads are first assembled and later
disassembled at the end of their life cycle. As one can see, the defined areas within the closed
system are limited to a relatively small, well-defined, and relatively permanent area within the
country.

facilities. The map is accessible here: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1RLx-
Q94vJDoPUpfA1oWbzPlkRPJpI-4&usp=sharing.

In Figure 2 below, a representative map has been drawn to define the closed system associated
with one of the central storage sites (Bryansk-18) in Russia. The warhead operational system for
each central storage area can be mapped in a similar fashion, showing the limited areas where
such operations are conducted and can be defined as closed system under a future agreement
addressing warheads.

storage facilities at other military bases. The map is accessible here:

sp=sharing.

As these figures depict, the closed warhead operational system covers a narrow system of
arteries and major depots rather than a broad and considerable amount of territory. These closed
systems are closely monitored by both countries, primarily through NTMs, and are well-defined
and understood.

The first step in developing a menu of verification measures, therefore, involves a declaration of
the locations, allowable transportation areas, and dedicated transportation and handling
equipment that make up each country’s warhead operational system.

### A. Process for Warheads to Enter and Exit a Closed System

As CNS described in our demonstration of the WTS, warheads are added to the database when
they are transferred from the custody of the Department of Energy (DOE) to the Department of
Defense (DoD) in the US and from the custody of the Ministry of Atomic Energy (Rosatom) to
the Ministry of Defense (MOD) in Russia. The date and time of the transfer of custody becomes
the first entry in the warhead passport. When a warhead reaches the end of its lifecycle, the same
process in reverse would record its exit. The last entry in the passport would be the transfer of
custody to DOE or Rosatom. Once again, this would apply even if a warhead is re-manufactured.
It will be accounted for as a new warhead if/when it is transferred back.

We also need to consider when warheads enter and exit the closed system by transfer to a
deployment base. In Russia, any transfer of a warhead from a storage bunker controlled by the
12 th Main Directorate (12th GUMO) to one of the military services would be a transfer out of the
closed warhead operational system. For the US and Russia, exits from the closed systems would
include transfers from bunkers to be installed on ICBMs, transfers to the Navy for deployment
on submarines, and removal of an ALCM or gravity bomb from a bunker and transferred to the
crew responsible for installing the weapon on an aircraft such as a bomber, or on any other
delivery vehicles or platforms. For the purposes of this paper, the warhead is considered leaving
the closed system once it passes from the service charged with maintaining the warheads in
storage to the crews of a warfighting Service. Given that both the US and Russia have declared
that all their warheads designed for tactical range systems are stored in central storage bunkers,
none of those warheads should exit the closed warhead operational system until they are
removed from service.

### Closed System B. Using Sensors on Support Equipment and Facility Infrastructure to Enclose Warheads within their

### within their Closed System

Having defined the concept of a closed warhead operational system, the next step in developing a
menu of verification measures is to identify ways to ensure in a verifiable manner that the system
remains closed, and all warheads are contained within it. Since it would be a safety and security
violation to attach any kind of sensors directly on warheads, another way to achieve this


objective is to place sensors on all the handling, transportation, and support equipment and on
the appropriate gates, entry ways, and nuclear security equipment at temporary and permanent
storage facilities. Sensors on the applicable handling equipment and transportation systems
would record the opening of any doors when the warhead is loaded, and sensors could also be
installed in the transportation system to record the loading as well. Sensors on the transportation
and handling equipment would also record the time, date, and route of the shipment and the
opening of doors and measurements of the presence or absence of a warhead in the transport
vehicle or railcar. Thus the data collected by such sensors will be matched by corresponding data
to be recorded in each warhead passport.

The key concept of this verification approach is that nuclear warheads cannot exist safely and
securely outside the closed system without specialized support equipment. Either side would
need a truck or train, or at least a gurney or forklift, to move a nuclear warhead to any non-
declared long-term storage location. The warheads would need extra security if they were moved
to a non-controlled location – even if stored temporarily in a truck, railcar, or non-declared
storage facility.

In other words, it would be difficult, if not impossible to secretly transfer warheads outside the
closed system for more than a short period of time. Even one warhead would require extensive
support, handling, and transportation equipment as well as a well-equipped crew that would
require astronomical levels of personnel reliability to operate on its own for extended periods.
Equally, if a country were to decide to create even a limited nuclear stockpile outside of any
declared warhead operational infrastructure under a bilateral or multilateral verification regime,
it would need to build a new closed system. Either approach would require considerable time and
effort to avoid eventual detection using NTM and other tools. To address these possible
violations, CNS proposes a verification regime with numerous tools and techniques to detect
violations and seek clarifications of any potential misunderstandings.

The closed system approach would require the sides to agree upon location(s) or facilities where
the sensors would be affixed on the newly produced support equipment to be used within the
nuclear warhead operational system and where the sensors would be removed upon disposal of
any equipment that reaches the end of its service life. These locations could be located outside a
production and/or a certification facility. The facilities would need to be declared, and an agreed
process developed to record items of interest leaving the facilities. A combination of video
cameras, open display for NTM, and collection of the data represented by hash codes would be
required.

These efforts would not make it impossible for the host party to produce equipment at another
production facility or another certification laboratory, but it would require the host party to spend
significant resources to supply non-declared support equipment. Since any warhead that existed
outside the closed system would need certified lifting equipment, HVAC support, security
personnel, and other support equipment if stored for more than a couple of weeks, the more
difficult it would be to hide a warhead outside the closed system. The host party would need to
illicitly produce handling equipment at declared or non-declared production facilities, and would
need to move and store all of that equipment without ever being detected. When combined with


measures to monitor warhead movements, the closed system approach provides greater chances
that illicit activities would be detected by the inspecting party at some point in the lifecycle of a
warhead.

Certainly, untagged support equipment that resembles similar equipment used within the
warhead operation system may be in used in multiple places outside the closed system. Such
locations would be strong candidates to be declared as suspect sites. In addition, the presence of
support equipment at a facility that has the signature of warhead storage would call for a suspect-
site inspection (see Section III. E. Functional Verification Activities: Suspect Site Inspections).

If all support equipment is equipped with sensors that track their location throughout their
service life, and other sensors are installed on fixed infrastructure egresses that serve as
unmanned virtual portals, there would be no way for equipment to be used to move warheads
outside the closed system without sensors detecting a violation. No certified handling equipment
with sensors should ever be located outside the closed system, so, if any such sensors were
identified during suspect site inspections, it would indicate a violation. It would be difficult to
move equipment without sensors into the closed system and move warheads out of the closed
system without risking detection by data analyses or any other type of inspection. In particular, if
the closed system were to include a comprehensive virtual portal monitoring system that is
recording everything going in and out of the gates at storage sites or transfer sites then there
would be even more difficult to move equipment in or out of the closed system without being
detected or without leaving a gap in data that is not properly accounted for. Under a closed
system approach with handling, transport, and nuclear security equipment that are sensored, all
movements in and out of the closed system can be recorded and correlated with additional data
compiled within warhead passports and exchanged under data challenges to cryptographically
protected stockpile data.

### C. Requirements for Sensors

Even though the sensors proposed under the closed system approach are not attached to the
warheads themselves, sensors affixed to handling, transportation, and security equipment would
have to be designed so that they collect the data without transmitting it in real time or during
operations – otherwise the safety, security, and reliability of the stockpile may be compromised.
Therefore, the sensor would need to include strong tamper protection, and measures would need
to be developed to collect the data after operations are conducted – either by conducting an on-
site spot check visit of the support equipment when it is safely parked and secured in its storage
area and not in use, or by the host country collecting the data and providing it to the other side by
using cryptographically generated hash codes, in the same way as warhead passport data would
be exchanged under the WTS methodology. Therefore, all support equipment would be equipped
with non-transmitting sensors and seals to monitor their movements and activities.

If the sensors and seals are non-transmitting, there would be no way for the other side to monitor
warhead locations in real time, thus protecting sensitive information. Such sensors would
maintain location awareness in a way that is internal to the sensor and does not rely on external
inputs and is incapable of transmitting external outputs. They would store a record of routes


taken and locations over time using, for example, an inertial sensor that would only be revealed
when an appropriate data reader/retrieval device is plugged in. The sensor could be installed in a
sealed, black box, for example, and would reveal if the truck or other equipment deviated from a
route within the closed system, thus flagging a violation. The violation would not be detected in
real time but would be discovered upon interrogation of the sensor – either through a data
challenge requiring the host party to reveal the data from the sensor or while collected on-site
during a spot check inspection of handling and transportation equipment. It would be very
important to have the sensor installed with tamper indication properties. Navigational sensors
that can track routes for individual trucks or other vehicles are currently available on the open
market. For example, the “Drive Right” sensor^2 pictured in Figure 3 plugs into the cigarette
lighter of a vehicle and can be operated with or without GPS or Bluetooth turned on.

Figure 3. This sensor is available from a company in the UK, and each one costs around fifty
dollars. The sensor would need further development to be tamper-proof or put in a tamper proof
box on the vehicle, and some vehicular modifications might be necessary, or the sensor might
need to be modified to provide its own power source. Nevertheless, even for a truck fleet of
2,000 vehicles, the total cost of the sensors would be around $ 1 00,000 plus modifications – well
within arms control verification budgets.

Simple tamper-proof locking and unlocking sensors can also be installed on all doors, gates, and
other openings of transport systems and facility infrastructure within the closed system to record
movements in and out of any given opening. Russian warhead storage facilities, for example, are
surrounded by fencing, with a main gate for entry and an emergency exit gate. Sensors emplaced
on these gates could be used to record every time that gate is opened, how long it is open for, and
when it is closed. Every time a vehicle transgresses these openings, the sensor captures the date,
time, and duration of the opening. These simple sensors could be affixed in such a way that they
act as a virtual portal around warhead storage and transfer facilities. This concept of a virtual,
unmanned portal could also be extended along transportation routes by installing cameras at key
locations in tamper proof protective shielding to record when transportation systems traverse
certain routes and could even be used to record the speed of travel.

The arms control community has conducted significant research and development efforts on
developing all sorts of tamper-proof and tamper-indicating devices to support previous arms
control agreements. A recent example of current research is the work conducted by Savannah
River National Laboratory (SRNL) engineers on tamper-indicating devices that was presented to
the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management European Safeguards Research and Development
Association (INMMERSADA) in Vienna in 2023.^3 As shown in Figure 4 below, SRNL
developed a prototype tamper-indicating device for automatic robotic application that can check
the serial number and integrity of a seal on a nuclear material container. Similar devices could be
designed for gates, truck and railcar door locks, and other warhead handling, transportation, and
infrastructure equipment. Other examples are provided in Annex A.

Once again, the data could either be collected by an on-site inspection team through an on-site
spot check visit or be collected by the host country and used to create a cryptographic hash code
that could be shared with the other side on a negotiated frequency. The data could then be
revealed through the same kind of data challenge process as previously described for warhead
passports. With sensors installed with tamper-proof or tamper-indicating seals on all handling,
transportation, and nuclear security equipment, an inspection team could collect and accumulate
data on the movement and location of all declared support equipment through on-site spot check
visits. That side could also obtain such information through data challenges of host-provided data
in the form of cryptographically produced hash codes.

### Form the Foundation of a Verification Approach D. Using the Concept of a Closed Warhead Operational System Together with Warhead Passports to

### Passports to Form the Foundation of a Verification Approach

The concept of a Warhead Tracking System (WTS) previously developed by CNS provides for
the development of unique identifiers for individual warheads based on life cycle logistics and
operational data derived for each warhead. That data is then protected and represented by
cryptographically generated hash codes. Our assumption in developing this concept is that the
US DoD and Russian MOD currently monitor the locations and usage of all handling equipment
within their respective inventory management systems. This is based on technical exchanges
conducted under the CTR nuclear security cooperation supporting development and
implementation of the Russian inventory management system.

When the data used in the passport that defines each warhead is combined with the data collected
from the sensors of the handling, transportation, and nuclear security equipment used to define
the closed system, a complex verification system is created that requires that all this data on
warhead movements and operations matches in an integrated system. So, for every movement,
data would be generated by sensors installed on all the support equipment while complementary
data was being recorded and collected within each warhead passport. Every warhead passport
transaction would be examined to determine whether it matched the data recorded by the relevant
handling, transportation, and nuclear security equipment. And the data collected by the sensors in
the closed system during every warhead movement and operation would similarly be analyzed to
assess whether it matched the data recorded in the relevant warhead passport(s). Much depends
on the technology of the sensor. They can be made quite difficult to tamper – it is impossible to
create a 100 percent tamper proof sensor given unlimited time and effort – and even more
difficult to tamper without being detected by examining data from multiple sources.

During a warhead road-to-rail transfer operation, for example, the transaction would be captured
in the warhead passport indicating the date, time, and place when the warhead was transferred
from the road crew to the rail crew. While that operation was taking place, the sensor in the truck
would record the route taken to arrive at the rail transfer site. The sensor on the truck door would
record that it was opened at a precise time – which should be consistent with the passport data -
and closed immediately following its removal. An additional sensor emplaced inside the truck
could also be recording data on the dates and times when the truck had a warhead loaded and
when that warhead was unloaded. Handling equipment such as a forklift would have a sensor to


collect data on its movements and locations as it is being used to remove the warhead from the
truck and carried to the railcar. Those sensors could record the date and time of the lift and
transfer. The sensors on the railcar would record when the back door was opened and when the
tray was pulled out, when the warhead was affixed to the tray, when the tray was put back in
place, and when the door closed, culminating the warhead transfer. For every warhead
transaction there would need to be corresponding data from the sensors affixed to specific
handling and transportation systems that confirm the operation within the closed system. The
data analytics assessing the data integration would not be conducted in real time but could be
conducted for every transaction at an agreed timeframe after the data is collected.

If a warhead were to be observed outside the closed system, then the unique identifier data
previously captured for that warhead would contain either non-reported data or falsified data, or
there would have been no unique identifier data exchanged at all for that warhead. Such a
scenario would constitute a violation of the verification regime under an agreement addressing
total warhead inventory.

As demonstrated in our previous project, developing the concept of warhead passports
represented by cryptographically generated hash codes assumes that historical warhead locations
and logistical data have already been exchanged between the US and Russia. If it is possible to
exchange data for warheads, then it would certainly be possible to exchange data for warhead
handling and transportation systems included in the overall closed warhead operational system.

Both sides are fully familiar with each other’s nuclear warhead storage sites, infrastructure, and
transportation routes, having conducted on site visits and exchanged transportation data under
the CTR nuclear security program.^4 In fact, the CTR program provided Russia with a significant
quantity of the transportation and nuclear security systems used at Russian storage sites today.
All the equipment was inspected closely by both sides during the procurement, delivery, and
installation procedures at neutral locations and therefore, could theoretically be examined on site
at neutral locations by arms control inspectors as well. US personnel have visited almost all the
Russian warhead storage facilities, and Russian technical experts have conducted on-site visits to
US warhead storage facilities at F.E. Warren Air Force Base and Kings Bay, GA naval base.^5
The United States conducted a presentation of a warhead transportation convoy to the Russians
at F.E. Warren, and, under CTR, US and Russian technicians designed and produced vehicles,
containers, railcars, and even designed the tie-downs used for Russian warhead transportation.
Russian experts have also visited the Pantex facility under an exchange program with the US
Department of Energy/NNSA. The locations and support infrastructure associated with nuclear
warheads are also well understood in the open-source community monitoring warheads.

(^4) For security reasons, data on warheads cannot be exchanged in real time. We posited that data could not be shared
until after a period of at least 30 days based on Russia’s willingness to provide such data 30 days after shipments
conducted under the CTR program. Transportation and handling equipment can be examined, and was examined
under the CTR program on-site and in real time when not in the process of handling warheads.
(^5) For a first-hand account of the Russian visits and of a Russian nuclear exercise, see:
https://www.stimson.org/ppl/william-m-moon/


Arms control operations for a verification protocol addressing nuclear warheads could be
conducted in the same way as was done for strategic weapons sites in START I and New
START. First, baseline data on support equipment would be declared, notified, and periodically
validated in the closed warhead operating system. Data would also include locations and
movements of trucks, railcars, gurneys, cranes, certified lifting equipment, containers, and even
aircraft. Second, warhead transportation and handling equipment could be examined, and data
collected from the attached sensors. Third, there could be a system of notifications about
movements of support equipment, for example if certain items are moved from one site to
another. Some or all the data gathered and shared between the sides on transportation and
handling equipment could be exchanged in the same way as warheads under our WTS system –
recorded via a cryptographic hash code. The sides would need to negotiate the extent to which
data on the warhead transportation and handling equipment is exchanged or collected in its raw
form or represented by cryptographic hash codes.

None of that equipment could be used to move warheads – or anything else -- outside the closed
system or used to support undeclared warheads located outside the closed system.Violations
would be detected through on-site spot check visits of the support equipment sensors, by
examining the reported data, and correlating it with hashed warhead passport data. Any support
equipment entering or exiting a secure area without being registered by seals and sensors on
gates and doors of a secure area would indicate a potential violation whether going in or out of
the secure area.

Over time, as more and more data from warhead passports are revealed through data challenges,
and more data is collected directly through on-site spot check visits of sensors installed on
handling, transportation, and nuclear security equipment, the sides will be able to correlate data
involved in a particular warhead movement or operation. This process, however, need not be
random or haphazard. Each side can schedule its on-site spot check visits based on the
information revealed through previous data challenges, and future data challenges can be
developed in accordance with the information discovered during the spot check visits. This
iterative correlation of warhead passport data and information stored on support equipment
sensors will increase the sides’ confidence that all movements and operations are being
conducted within the closed system and that there are not any non-declared warheads operating
within the closed system nor any support equipment moved or used outside the closed system.

Given that each side understands how the data are integrated, they can design their data
challenges on warhead passport data and on their on-site spot check visits of the support
equipment sensors to increase their confidence that all movements and operations are being
conducted within the closed system and that there are not any non-declared warheads operating
within the closed system. One important caveat to remember is that none of the data from either
source would be shared in real time, so the confidence only applies to historical operations at an
agreed number of days (likely at least 30 days prior, if not longer). This delay represents, in our
view, an acceptable compromise between the sensitivity of real-time data and the need to build
verifiable trust as well as a reasonable probability of detecting and reacting to potential
violations.


The amount of data that could be subject to collection and compilation could be quite extensive
considering warhead passport data and all the associated support equipment such as the lifting
equipment, cranes, gurneys, tie-downs, trucks, railcars, aircraft, or any other equipment involved
in warhead operations. Clearly, the parties to any agreement would need to negotiate how much
of that data would be subject to collection and how much would be subject to data challenges.
Based on previous CTR exchanges, however, we know that all such data is being gathered and
collected by existing inventory management systems and does not require either side to create
new data. The closed warhead operational system ensures that allowable activities within the
system can be tracked, validated, and verified.

### Equipment Required to Support Every Transaction in All Warhead Passports E. Using a zk-SNARK Tool to Conduct Analytics on Data Collected from Transportation and Handling

### Handling Equipment Required to Support Every Transaction in All Warhead Passports

There are two ways to integrate and compare data collected by sensors on transportation,
handling, and nuclear security equipment with data compiled in the warhead passports used as
unique identifiers for each warhead. The data can be collected through data challenges issued for
one or both sets of data, in which case the revealed data can be examined by the challenging side
and compared to confirm consistencies and identify any anomalies.

The second way to conduct the data analytics would be to use a zk-SNARK (Zero Knowledge
Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) tool like the one CNS developed and
demonstrated alongside the WTS in December 2022. This tool allows an inspecting party to
assess the integrity of warhead passport data without revealing the data itself. It can directly
interrogate the data that was used to generate a representative hash code and confirm for the
other party whether the data has been compiled in accordance with rules specified by the two
parties. In this case, the tool would need to be programmed to assess the integration of data from
the warhead passports and from the sensors on the transportation, handling, and nuclear security
equipment to see that every relevant warhead operation can be confirmed by transactions
recorded in the warhead passport and all equipment used in that specific transaction. This can all
be done without any of the data being revealed to the other side, but if done on a regular and
sustained basis, it can confirm that all the data that is being collected follows the rules in place
for all warhead operations.

### Data F. Corroborating and Cross-Referencing Warhead Passport Data and Support Equipment Handling

### Handling Data

Utilizing our closed system concept that would entail placing sensors on all handling,
transportation, and nuclear security systems, there would not be any warhead operation that
could be conducted without generating data that would be collected by multiple sensors and
without generating an additional, complementary transaction captured within the warhead
passport. Even a routine security check would generate data collected by a sensor on the gate or
doorway leading into the bunker where the warhead is stored, and that operation would generate
a complementary or matching transaction within the warhead passport. All warhead operations,
therefore, would produce one or more transactions that make up the warhead passport which


would require corroborating data collected by transport, handling, or nuclear security equipment
contained within the closed warhead operational system. Under this verification concept, two
sets of data on all transactions conducted on warheads would be captured and available to
corroborate -- either by a manual examination of revealed data or by a validation check
conducted by a zk-SNARK tool on the data represented by hash codes. Even if very little data
has been revealed, the sides would gain confidence in the validity of the data representing the
applicable warhead stockpiles through data analytics, and the confidence level would increase
further over time as more data are revealed, correlated, and corroborated. Data challenges and
random on-site spot check visits could then be designed to increase confidence even further.

This system would greatly deter cheating because it would require either that false data be
entered into both the handling systems and the warhead passports, or that data be omitted from
both. In the latter case, a void of data would be detected through the logic checks conducted by
the zk-SNARK that could be followed up with specific data challenges. With such strong
controls and data collection within the closed system, and in detecting and collecting data on all
warheads and handling equipment entering or exiting the closed system, the difficulty for either
side to maintain an inventory of non-reported warheads would increase. Any equipment with
sensors detected at non-sanctioned locations through suspect site inspections would constitute a
violation, as would the presence of any related warhead. It would be quite difficult for either side
to move declared warheads and/or declared support equipment outside of the closed system
without violating the provisions that govern allowable warhead operations, movements, and
locations in a future agreement.

With these measures in place, non-declared sites and activities required to support non-declared
warheads can be more easily spotted and identified, because violations could be detected not
only by spotting and identifying a suspect warhead, but also by identifying declared support
equipment in a non-declared location or undeclared support equipment at a suspect site capable
of supporting non-declared warheads. Thus, no declared equipment could be used to move
warheads outside the closed system or used to support undeclared warheads located outside the
closed system without being detected by sensors on entry/exit points or by on-site spot check
visits of the support equipment locations. The on-site spot checks could include gathering data
from the sensors and combined with a data challenge procedure to reveal data from relevant
warhead passport(s) that together would increase confidence that no unauthorized equipment or
warheads have been moved in or out of the closed system. By using these measures together, the
verification regime would make it difficult to move either support equipment or warheads in or
out of the closed system. Once a comprehensive closed system is established and operating, a
country would have to develop and operate a non-declared warhead production facility and
develop outside production facilities for all required handling, transportation, and nuclear
security equipment in order to maintain a stockpile of non-declared warheads outside the closed
system. It would also require them to maintain highly reliable, separate security forces to sustain
any number of warheads completely outside the closed system.

To mitigate the risk of warheads and support equipment all produced and maintained outside the
closed system without detection, CNS proposes that the sides consider the possibility of using


additional sensors at other sites, such as conventional weapons storage sites, that would be
declared suspect sites. This smaller set of sensors would help detect the illegal presence of
nuclear warheads at any suspect site that might possess capabilities like nuclear warhead
handling, transportation, and security equipment. This measure would further narrow the options
available to circumvent a closed system verification regime and thus enhance the capabilities of
traditional suspect site verification measures to detect any potential oasis containing all the
required support, handling, transport, and nuclear security capabilities and warheads. These
measures will be explained further in the suspect site inspection section later in this paper.

## III. Menu of Verification Technologies, Devices, Measures, and Procedures

Using the cryptographic techniques that CNS developed to support data exchanges on warheads,
it would be possible to pursue traditional arms control measures such as have been used for
START and New START. In order to increase confidence for an arms control regime addressing
warheads without violating security and safety concerns, we offer an alternative closed system
concept for consideration. Instead of seeking methods to identify warheads based on their
composition, this approach would help verify declarations by closely monitoring support,
handling, and nuclear security equipment used within warhead operations together with data
from warhead passports.

For this approach, our menu of verification technologies, devices, measures, and procedures has
been organized into five functional categories tied to the operation of this closed operational
warhead system: A) Functional Verification Activities Establishing a Closed Warhead
Operational System; B) Functional Verification Activities Monitoring Containers, Trucks,
Railcars, Aircraft, and Nuclear Security Systems; C) Functional Verification Activities: On-Site
Visits/Challenges at Declared Facilities; D) Functional Verification Activities: Displays and
Close-Outs; and E) Functional Verification Activities: Suspect Sites.

Within each of these functional categories, we have identified the verification activity itself, the
verification targets, the goal of this verification measure, the techniques and technologies that
can be used, and the negotiability and procedural and technical precedents of the functions,
techniques, and technologies identified. We address and describe the intrusiveness of the
techniques and technologies in each section as well.

### A. Functional Verification Activities Establishing a Closed Warhead Operational System

Once the sides declare all the locations, including allowable travel corridors, that constitute the
closed warhead operational system, the next step would be to install sensors on all applicable
transport, handling, and nuclear security equipment that would be operated within the system.
These sensors act together to function as a virtual, unattended portal monitoring system. One
important point, however, is that none of these sensors would have the capability to transmit
data. While the ability to transmit data would increase confidence in the integrity of the closed


system in real time, such a capability, if realized, would pose an unacceptable security violation
and create security vulnerabilities for both sides.

Our proposed approach would involve sensors that collect relevant data to establish and maintain
the closed system and would use cryptography to protect the data until the sides agree to share
some of the data through negotiated data challenges and on-site spot check visits to collect data
from the sensors at neutral, allowable locations at least 30 days after the last operation has been
completed. That is why all of the sensors we are proposing for handling, transport, and nuclear
security equipment will require robust seals that record the data and time of any use of the
applicable equipment.

The targets of these functional verification activities include all transport, handling, and nuclear
security systems within the closed system. All doors and gates where warheads could pass
through would be equipped with sensors that record every time they are opened, how long they
are opened, and when they are closed. All transport equipment would be equipped with sensors
that measure the routes they traverse and the dates and times of all movements. As described
above in our explanation of our verification concept, these sensors would not function with GPS
but with inertial technologies and would not include capabilities to transmit the data off-site. The
doors and openings of these transportation systems would also be equipped with sensors
identifying the times and locations where they have sensors to record when the equipment was
used and what function it performed. The sides would negotiate which containers would be
equipped with sensors as well. Sensors on containers may be more sensitive than sensors on
other support and handling equipment, so if a comprehensive agreement on all other equipment
can be negotiated, the side may want to forego attaching a sensor to a container with a warhead
inside it since that may pose safety or security concerns, but any containers that may be used
during transportation, or that are located in the closed system for any time that they do not
contain a warhead, would need to be sealed with a sensor that identifies when the seal is in place
and what times it was broken in order to conduct a specified operation.

Even when support equipment must be moved to a maintenance facility, for example, the
verification regime should include a protocol to declare such facilities and enable the closed
system to account for movements to and from such facilities.

The process of establishing and maintaining the closed system would not require particularly
intrusive techniques and technologies. Under our closed system approach, the sensors would be
affixed or installed when the transportation systems are not in use and this process would be
accomplished at their secure parking areas or at nearby neutral, non-sensitive areas. This would
require the inspecting team to send an installation team in-country, but they would go to
locations where arrangements for US or Russian personnel can be made as was demonstrated
during the implementation of nuclear security cooperation under the CTR agreement. None of
the technologies we have identified would include the capability to transmit data off-site, and all
the data collected by the sensors could be protected by generating hash codes to represent the
data until such time that the sides agree to disclose that data.


Installation of sensors on handling and lifting equipment would be more intrusive – at least for
those systems used within bunkers. It would not be too difficult or disruptive to move forklifts to
a secure parking area nearby, but that could be problematic for some cranes, and especially for
cranes inside bunkers. For such cases, the sides would need to determine the necessity for
placing seals or sensors on non-mobile cranes.

As shown in Table 1, our menu includes other sensors that would be considered more intrusive
than the simple seals and route measuring devices described so far. These include cosmic ray and
thermal neutron sensors that could be installed inside transportation systems such as trucks and
railcars to detect and record when warheads are inside the cargo area. Weigh scales are another
possible sensor that could be used within transportation vehicles such as trucks or railcars.
Sensors intended to detect and potentially count warheads are more intrusive, expensive, and
complex than tags and seals on doors and lifting equipment, and there could be concern from the
host country that the sensors could gather sensitive data. While they would be designed and
calibrated in such a way that they would not measure or collect sensitive data on the composition
or design of any warheads, they could be calibrated to not only detect the presence of a warhead,
but also to count the number of distinct warheads within the cargo space. These types of
technologies would provide a greater level of confidence in the verification system than more
simple seals and sensors attached to the tie-downs inside the transportation system’s cargo space,
but they would be much more intrusive. We looked at potential technologies that might also be
used to detect whether a nuclear warhead was recently inside a specific cargo area, but the
technology required for such readings would be even more intrusive and would not greatly
increase verification confidence under our approach.

We also included a quantum tracker in our menu. This is a more advanced technology and may
be considered even more intrusive and difficult to negotiate because it is not as well understood
and could create hesitancy in gaining acceptance, but quantum technologies can be used to
enhance the confidence in seals and route measuring devices and may not involve significant
cost increases. We assess that quantum technologies could be a future enhancement to
verification technologies and techniques that should be considered at a later stage in the
negotiating process.

A warhead verification protocol would also need to include technologies and measures to
monitor storage sites, transfer points, and production/disassembly facilities. Thinking further
about the concept of a closed warhead operational system, the idea to monitor storage sites,
transfer points, and production/disassembly facilities is conceptually like establishing a virtual,
unmanned portal. Using similar seals on the gates and doors of these facilities can provide
complementary monitoring capabilities – especially when they are correlated with the data
collected from the transport systems through data exchange or through data obtained from the
sensors, as well as with data contained in the warhead passports.

To be sure, with production/disassembly facilities it may be difficult to discriminate between
activity relevant to the proposed verification regime (warheads exiting or entering the facility)
and other activities involving the opening of the gate(s). Such a system may be deemed


excessively intrusive by Russia if they perceive the US proposal provides information outside the
purview of the agreement.

When it comes to nuclear warhead storage sites, however, it is useful to analyze the details
associated with the security systems that surround them. These details are well known based
upon years of nuclear security cooperation between the US and Russia under the CTR program,
to include joint design of the security systems at Russian sites and Russian visits to US based
bunkers at FE Warren AFB and the Kings Bay, GA Naval base. The fencing around the bunkers
for US and Russian warhead storage sites each have two entrance points, but one is typically
used only for emergencies. Therefore, it may be possible to apply a seal on the emergency exit
that would indicate any intrusion, and another one at the main entrance that could be used to
indicate when and how often the gate was opened. Under the least possible level of intrusiveness,
the data could be entered by the host country and represented by hash codes that could be
challenged by the other side at later, random dates. A medium level of intrusiveness could
involve the use of video to permit the other side to have a visual record of the representatives of
the host country collecting and entering the data without hash codes. The most intrusive
approach would involve an on-site spot check visit to the bunkers where the inspection team
would collect the data from the sensors during the visit. The sensors would need to be tamper-
proof and able to detect any tampering or hacking capability.

Since NTM is already being used to monitor these sites, NTM data could be correlated with data
collected from the sensors, which would enhance confidence in the validity of data on activities
at these sites to a level higher than it is today.

Based on our CTR knowledge and experience, we also know that both sides use radiation
detection sensors at the entrances to the bunker sites. From a nuclear security perspective these
are used primarily to ensure there is not an unauthorized exit of radiological material from the
site when certain vehicles exit. Personnel exit sites through special personnel gates that do not
permit larger objects to pass through. It would be slightly more intrusive for the sides to
exchange data that is already being collected from these sensors, but by doing so such data
would provide an additional layer of confidence in the validity of the reported data. For an even
higher confidence level, the sides could also add a sensor reader to the gate system that would be
used to identify, and perhaps take a video or picture, of every vehicle that passes through the
gate. We know that the security systems already monitor, gather, and store such video data, and
such data could be shared at an agreed date and time after such an operation is conducted. If this
were combined with another sensor to record the serial number of each vehicle passing through
the gate, read at the gate by a permanently affixed serial number or bar code, then there would
also be a record of every time the gates were opened. That record could be analyzed to determine
whether it corresponded with the movement of a vehicle that transported a warhead in or out of
the facility. Such a procedure would require the collection of data on all traffic transiting the
gate.

The security systems at the Russian Rail Transfer Points (RTPs) are designed in a similar way as
those at permanent storage sites. These security systems were also jointly developed and
implemented under the CTR nuclear security cooperation program. In this case, each railcar that


transited through each gate would be recorded and the data would be collected to indicate
whether it was loaded or unloaded (corroborated by warhead passport data).

For an even more intrusive menu, advanced radiation techniques could be employed that not
only identify whether a truck or railcar was empty or loaded when it passed through the gate, but
that could also identify the number, type, or even individual warhead(s) involved in the
movement.

All the techniques and technologies we have identified to perform the function of establishing a
closed warhead operational system are based on successfully implemented precedents that
indicate that such measures have a high potential of negotiability. If a political/military
environment exists that would be conducive to technical discussions on an agreement addressing
warheads, our analysis and menu have identified an approach to establishing a closed system
with techniques and technologies that offer opportunities for a potential agreement.

### B. Functional Verification Activities Monitoring Containers, Trucks, Railcars, Aircraft

Under our concept of a closed warhead operational system, there are several verification
technologies and measures that can be used to record data on warhead handling, transportation,
and nuclear security system operations. Although we use the word “monitoring” to describe our
verification function, it would be more precise to note that the sensors are monitoring the
movements, and the sensor data would be collected by an inspection team during each on-site
spot check visit and would also be obtained through data challenges, and thus the data would not
be obtained in real time or on a continuous basis.

The first challenge is to obtain data concerning the movements of all this equipment to ensure it
stays within the closed system (including maintenance and repair facilities) and that records the
history of the routes followed for each of their movements. Non-transmitting route capturing
sensors such as the “Drive Right” system described above would be the least intrusive of the
technologies and devices that could be used. While the technology exists and there are some
devices available off-the-shelf, fully operational devices that would be required to fulfill this
mission would need further development in the arms control R&D community. Improved
devices exist but would require their own power source and would need to be either tamper proof
or tamper detectable. The sides would also want to make sure that these devices are not capable
of transmitting data and cannot be hacked. Design work would also be required for installation of
sensors on any/all transport systems and handling equipment that the sides would agree to
monitor. These could include everything from trucks and railcars to gurneys, cranes, and mobile
lifting equipment. Air transport planes and helicopters could be included in this category as well
if the sides agree to include these transport systems.

The data from the sensors could be gathered by the host country and recorded via a
cryptographic hash code that can be shared with the other side, or data could be gathered by the
inspection team during a spot check visit to a site where the support equipment is located. The
latter is more intrusive and therefore would likely be subject to limits on the number of such
visits per year.

The sensors and/or seals installed on the doors on the transport systems to establish and maintain
the closed system (described above) should also collect data on the date and time when they are
opened and closed, which will indicate when warheads are being loaded or unloaded. Such seals
can be designed to record the date/time of every opening and closing. The technology for such
seals exists off-the-shelf, but again it would need further design and application work to affix it
onto the specific vehicular doors. In addition to seals on doors, it may also be possible to affix
such seals on warhead tie-downs that secure the warhead container to the transport mechanism.
During CTR cooperation on nuclear security, the US and Russia held technical discussions and
jointly designed and produced tie downs for supercontainers that were provided to Russia for
warhead transportation and storage, so there is precedent for tie downs that would not be overly
intrusive.

Other technologies and techniques identified above to establish and maintain the closed system
could also be used to record data on the loading and unloading of warheads on transportation


systems. Within trucks and railcars for instance, an inspection team could use a detector to
measure potential emanations from warheads that would indicate that a warhead was loaded in
the vehicle within a certain amount of time. Such an approach to recording data on loading and
unloading warheads could be simplified if certain seals were affixed to warhead containers that
would be “read” or detected by a bar code reader installed in the transportation system, but we
have not included these in our menu because we believe the sides would not allow any type of
seal to be placed directly on a warhead container. Under the Warhead Safety and Security
Exchange (WSSX) program, US and Russian teams worked together on developing a system that
could detect the movement or removal of a warhead from a storage bunker. The Russian team
strongly opposed any methodology that would directly affix a technology or sensor directly on a
warhead or its container. Instead, together they developed a system of wires that would closely
surround the warhead in its container that would achieve that objective without physically
touching the warhead or container. If current warheads and monitoring technologies were able to
overcome these earlier safety objections and the sides were to agree on such a level of
intrusiveness, then using such a technology would provide a simpler solution.

Our menu includes technologies and techniques that could be placed at specific locations along
designated routes. These technologies and techniques would be relatively simple, such as using
NTM or placing video or still cameras but would be considered more intrusive if their placement
were to reveal sensitive information on transportation routes. In our description of the closed
system concept, we noted that the sides would need to identify transportation corridors in their
initial declaration. This could be accomplished by simply identifying the origin and end points in
the system, but such a declaration may not be sufficient for the sides to accept. If the sides were
able to agree upon one or more locations along designated routes, this would increase
verification confidence and would enable the use of video or still cameras to be installed at such
locations to record truck, rail, or even air shipments passing through the specified egress. Drones
and scintillator fibers installed at these locations could perform similar functions of gathering
data on transportation systems movements. Theoretically, drones could be used to follow
transportation movements, but this would likely be too intrusive given that drone movements
may increase capabilities to track movements in real time using NTM and we discarded this
technology from the design of our verification regime. In addition, drones would be providing a
duplicative function to internally installed transportation monitors using inertial technologies.
These concerns would need to be alleviated during negotiations before drone technologies could
be considered as an alternative to a specific on-site inspection.

If the sides were to agree to record transportation systems movements by agreeing to install
sensors at one or more designated locations along routes, it would be relatively easy to identify
the appropriate technology or technologies to be used to record the data. A reader could be
installed at the neutral location and another sensor could be applied to all relevant transportation
systems within the closed system. These could be simple bar code readers, for example, or
another non-transmissible technology.

While internally installed inertial route recording sensors would provide basic data on
movements within the closed system, additional sensors that could be placed along routes within


declared transportation corridors would provide an additional level of verification confidence in
the integrity of the closed system. In that case, data could be collected and analyzed from three
separate sources: inside the transportation system, from sensors along a route, and in the
warhead passport. As more of this data is revealed via data challenges or on-site spot check, or if
it is analyzed by a zk-SNARK tool, the corroboration of data from three sources would greatly
increase confidence in the collected data.

Table 2 below identifies these techniques and technologies as well as the applicable precedents
for each of the functions. These indicate that functional verification activities to record data on
movements of containers, handling equipment, and transportation systems are negotiable and
offer opportunities to address warheads in a future agreement.

### C. Functional Verification Activities: On-Site Visit/Challenges at Declared Facilities

Our third functional verification activity addresses how data would be collected by the inspection
team during on-site visits given that all the technologies in our menu are non-transmitting.

From a technical perspective, there is not much difference in how data would be collected during
such visits from the use of seals and sensors installed on handling, transportation, or nuclear
security equipment. The functional differences have more to do with access and access
procedures, so the verification activities for different kinds of locations are listed separately. This
distinction will be helpful for the development of a verification protocol for an agreement
addressing warheads.

All on-site spot check visits identified in this section would be conducted either on a regular
periodic basis or would be scheduled in accordance with challenge procedures. While one could
say that these are measures to monitor the sites, in reality they are spot checks of the sites that
would include the collection of data stored in the sensors.

On-site spot check visits to declared parking areas for trucks, railcars, and other transportation
modes would be much less intrusive than on-site inspections inside bunkers and US and Russian
personnel have previously been invited to visit such areas during previous technical exchanges
under the CTR agreement and military-to-military exchanges. Nevertheless, they would still
require the host country to accept an inspection team to those areas in its country. These areas,
and similar ones, have been subject to previous access visits as identified in the precedents
section of the chart below. Visits to such parking areas, or a nearby neutral site if preferred by
the host country, would seek first to confirm the absence of warheads within all the
transportation systems cargo areas. The simplest way to do this would be visual inspection by
opening all doors and entry points for the team to quickly observe inside. Rulers and measuring
tapes may be the only technologies required in that case. Access to the interior of some or all the
transportation systems may be required to collect data from the route sensors and seals installed
inside the systems. If such access were permitted under the agreed verification regime, the sides
could also consider allowing inspectors to use additional equipment such as quantum
gravitometers to detect whether underground bunkers or other underground functions might
exist. While the final list of equipment allowed for the inspecting party will depend on the
outcome of negotiations on the provisions in the verification protocol, precedents indicate that
some sort of access may be allowed to one or more of the transportation systems in their secure
parking areas.

If access was not allowed to all the transportation systems, but only to one or more systems, then
other more intrusive measures would be required if the doors and openings of the remaining
systems in the parking area are not going to be opened for inspection. Cosmic ray detectors and
ground penetrating radar devices could be used to confirm the absence of warheads in the
transportation systems and could even be used to check for potential underground facilities that
could hold a warhead below the parking area. Thermal neutron scanners could also be used to
examine trucks, railcars, and aircraft interiors to confirm the absence of warheads as well. We


consider these technologies more intrusive due to their cost, complexity, and the risk that
information on other sensitive objects that may be in the secure parking areas would be revealed.

In Table 3 below, we note that one of the goals of collecting the data would be to correlate it
with other data from warhead passports that has either been revealed or would be correlated by
using a zk-SNARK tool.

### D. Functional Verification Activities: Displays and Close-Outs.............................................................

#### Open Displays

Open displays and technical characteristics displays have been a part of many previous arms
control treaties and can help make significant contributions to verification of an agreement
addressing warheads using our closed system approach. Open displays of warheads would
probably not be permitted by either the US or Russia due to the sensitivities involved in
revealing information on the composition of any warhead displayed, but more importantly
because they would enable the other side to enhance their military targeting plans. Using our
concept of a closed system that focuses instead on collecting data on all the handling,
transportation, and nuclear security systems surrounding nuclear warhead operations, there are
several ways open displays could increase verification confidence.

One way to increase confidence would be for the sides to openly display trucks, railcars, and
even forklifts at designated locations and at designated dates and times. These would be
considered technical characteristics displays. The display itself might not reveal much, except
perhaps if the railcars were displayed with their trays pulled out, but, by recording the date and
time of the display in an open manner, the other side would have specific data on the precise
location of certain items. This would be helpful because that openly revealed data can be
confirmed later when route data from the sensors on these items are collected and analyzed to
confirm the open display. This would increase confidence in the other data that is collected by
the tamper proof sensors that depict the routes and locations of the items for their recent service
history. This data correlation analysis can be conducted using data revealed through other data
challenges, known events, and/or by using the zk-SNARK tool if the rest of the data has not been
revealed yet.

For example, the sides might agree to conduct an open display of specific on-site handling
equipment such as mobile cranes removed from the bunkers, forklifts, and gurneys, and even
open gates at a specific site for a designated amount of time on a specific day and time. In this
way, the other side will have some data that could be checked against the data collected from
those systems later during a spot check visit or data challenge. A more intrusive example of an
open display would involve a train or truck that may be photographed or captured on video
during a specific operation at a specific time and place. This would be more intrusive since it
could impact operations. But instead, if the open display was required just after an operation was
conducted, then a picture of the inside of an empty truck or railcar could also be required to be
taken at the same time as the open display. Then the picture could be captured by the host party
generating a hash code of the picture data at the specified time that would coincide with the time
of the open display. The picture would not be shared immediately but would be subject to a data
challenge at a later time.

When data from the picture and the sensors inside the truck or railcar are collected later by an
on-site spot check or through a data challenge, the data from these two sources could be
compared with the pictures taken by NTM during the open display. All three of these data
sources would need to match given that they are each gathering data from the same operation. In


this way, open displays can be helpful in gaining confidence in the other data that may be
collected from the railcar or truck sensors used in the open display. In this example, the
verification measures would not be very intrusive since the data from the NTM is non-intrusive,
the data from the picture(s) of the truck or railcar does not require on-site presence of the
inspecting party, and the data from the navigational sensors are not collected until a later on-site
spot check when the truck or railcar is securely stored long after the operation was conducted. At
the same time, by comparing, collating, and corroborating data from three different sources, the
inspecting party gains confidence in the validity of data it is collecting throughout this
verification activity.

#### Close-out Inspections.....................................................................................................................

A close-out inspection of a former warhead storage facility or former rail or air transfer facility
to confirm the absence of nuclear warheads, warhead handling equipment, and warhead
transportation equipment/vehicles would not be very different under our closed system approach
than what was done under previous arms control agreements. The main difference would be that
under the closed system approach the challenging side would be able to use the data challenge
process to reveal warhead passport information that shows the warheads previously located at the
site are no longer there, and data collected by sensors on transportation and handling systems
could be revealed by spot check visits or analyzed using the zk-SNARK tool to confirm that
appropriate transportation shipments to remove the warheads has taken place. In addition, all
relevant and negotiated handling equipment that was located at the site and had sensors installed
would either be inspected on site and destroyed, sent away from the site, or would already have
been transported offsite where the sensor data could be collected, and the sensors removed if the
equipment was designated for elimination.

If/when a side declares that it is closing and no longer using a warhead storage facility, there are
several different options available in our menu for the other side to confirm that the site has been
closed.

Given that close-out inspections would not have to be different under the closed system approach
than they have been in previous arms control treaties, a more detailed review of the procedures
that could be conducted using data from the closed system can help demonstrate how this
approach can increase confidence in the verification activity without increasing intrusiveness.
Under the closed system approach, for example, a large amount of data would be collected on the
warheads and operations conducted over the lifetime of a given facility. All of this data would
increase the confidence level of an on-site close-out inspection, or might even make it possible
for a facility close-out to be verified without requiring a site visit.

The following procedures could all be done remotely and observed via NTM:

- The host country issues a declaration of intent to close the facility. The declaration
    should include the site name and identifying features, the date of the removal of the
    last warhead, and the date of the close out inspection.
- The warhead passports for each of the warheads removed after the declaration of the
    closeout of the site would include data on the date/time of the warhead removal


```
from that site that are subject to being revealed to the other side through data
challenges or spot checks check visits or can be analyzed by a zk-SNARK function.
```
- The host country would take photos of the truck(s) and/or train(s) leaving the
    facility with the last of the warheads. The photos would be taken by the host country,
    converted to a hash code, and entered into the applicable warhead passports, thus
    making it subject to a data challenge.
- The host country would remove all nuclear warhead handling equipment,
    environmental controls, and all storage and transport containers capable of containing
    a nuclear warhead. All cranes and handling equipment including forklifts and gurneys
    would be removed from the site except for the crane to be used for placement of the
    King Tut blocks referenced below.
- An inspection team would gather data from the sensors of any/all cranes and handling
    equipment either on or off site, and the equipment would be disposed of in
    accordance with agreed procedures.
- The host country would remove all security equipment and devices within and around
    the nuclear storage bunkers, including all containers. All equipment should be
    removed from the security control room. Fencing may be left in place around the
    bunkers and around the perimeter of the secured weapons storage area, but all
    sensors, including fence disturbance systems, microwaves, and cameras should be
    removed from the fences and replaced with permanent, tamper-proof seals.
- The host country would take pictures of each of the empty bunkers after all
    equipment is removed and provide the pictures to the other side. The pictures should
    be used to immediately produce a hash code to verify the exact time/place of the
    picture taken.
- The host country would transport a “ **King Tut Block”**^6 to each bunker at the site and
    place a block at the opening of each of the bunkers. The host country would use a
    mobile crane to place the King Tut block, but the crane would be removed upon
    completion of the close out inspection and then be loaded on a truck or railcar and
    transported away from the site.
- Instead of placing a King Tut Block in front of each bunker at the site, the host
    country may choose to eliminate the bunkers by bulldozing or blowing up the bunkers
    and covering them with concrete.

All the above procedures could be carried out without requiring an on-site inspection. The
compilation of data, combined with NTM, would provide a certain level of confidence that
would be much higher than NTM alone. The confidence level could be increased further if the
sides were to agree to more intrusive measures. So, in addition to the steps identified above, a
close out inspection team would be allowed on site to view the interior of each bunker and verify
that all equipment has been removed from inside the bunkers. Data gathered through the closed

(^6) King Tut blocks are used in nuclear security as large concrete structures with heavy rebar implanted that are
difficult to remove without very heavy lifting equipment and are difficult to blow apart with explosives due to the
high density of rebar installed within. They are also large enough to allow easy monitoring via NTM and can be
embedded with unique identifiers that could also be monitored by NTM.


system approach could be further combined with limited on-site procedures such as outlined
below:

- As the team inspects each bunker, the team would place a seal on the door when it is
    closed, and the inspectors would view the placement of the King Tut blocks and place a
    seal on them as well.
- Bunker doors would be opened and upon completion of the inspection team’s inspection
    inside the bunker, the inspection team would instruct a representative of the host country
    to place the King Tut block in front of the door, where it would be affixed or sealed to the
    ground. The representative of the host country would take pictures on site that are
    immediately shared with the inspection team. The copies of these pictures would be
    captured and represented by an identical hash code and the sides would verify that they
    match.
- The inspection team would also place seals on each gate of the fencing around each
    storage bunker as they complete their inspection. They would also place seals on each
    gate entrance to the secure area within which the storage facilities/storage bunkers are
    located. These would be tamper-proof seals that would never be permitted to be broken
    without conducting a follow-up inspection.
- Upon closing and sealing the King Tut Blocks in front of each bunker, and seals placed
    on any other suspect door or opening identified by the inspection team, the inspection
    team would seal the perimeter of the warhead storage area with a fiber optic seal strung
    through the fencing of the entire perimeter at its uppermost and lowermost heights as
    selected by the inspection team. Again, these would be tamper-proof seals that would not
    be permitted to be opened without the presence of an inspection team.

It would be possible to increase confidence even further if the sides were to agree to an even
more intrusive procedure. In this case, the inspection team would be permitted to use ground
penetrating radar to inspect all areas in and around the site to ensure that there are no
underground storage spaces on site. If they wanted to go even further, the sides could agree to
procedures like those conducted by CTR to eliminate warhead bunkers in Ukraine: removal of
all equipment, filling in the bunker with concrete and dirt, removal of all security fencing,
covering the former bunkers with concrete, and converting the facility back to a “green field.”

### E. Functional Verification Activities: Suspect Site Inspections

Generally speaking, a suspect-site inspection (SSI) is an on-site inspection activity at a location
that has not been previously declared as containing an item limited by the particular treaty or
agreement; the purpose of such an inspection is to confirm that the treaty-limited items (in this
case, nuclear warheads and associated support equipment) are not located at that site. For our
menu, we have also included declared conventional storage sites as subject to suspect site
functional verification activities since such sites may be configured in ways similar to nuclear
warhead storage sites, and may have similar handling, transportation, and nuclear security
equipment. We have identified several potential observable indicators that may raise suspicions
that a suspect site is an undeclared storage site. Such indicators include:

- Characteristic signatures of a nuclear warhead storage site. Characteristic features may
    include bunkers typical for each side and the presence of typical transportation nodes.
    However, the same features may be present at conventional warhead storage sites and --
    at least in Russia -- nuclear warheads can be stored in temporary nuclear warhead storage
    sites that do not possess all these characteristics. Such temporary locations may store
    nuclear warheads for hours or weeks, depending on the warhead operation that may be
    involved.
- The presence of support equipment, such as containers like those used for nuclear
    warheads, vehicles, and railcars. Such equipment may be the same or similar to the
    equipment that can be found at storage sites for conventional warheads.

We have reviewed a number of suspect-site inspection regimes (START I, CFE, CWC, and
CTBT) and, given that such equipment may be similar to the equipment that can be found at
storage sites for conventional warheads, the sides should agree on the list of such equipment and
clearly identify the observable features which may differentiate such equipment from similar
items associated with nuclear warhead storage sites. If those features that differentiate the sites
are not observable, or are difficult to observe via NTM, such sites could be declared as specific
suspect sites that would be subject to a challenge on-site inspection at a specified frequency. It
may also be advisable to consider other features characteristic of nuclear warhead storage sites,
such as the characteristic signatures (bunkers, buildings, security systems, and transportation
nodes), to help further narrow down the category of suspect sites that should be declared under
the relevant agreement. This is particularly important for Russian sites that emphasize dual
capability of delivery vehicles, but also applies to the United States with respect to ALCM
storages and even broader if nuclear warheads are once again produced for SLCMs. In such a
situation, the sides, using these and other criteria, would agree on a list of declared sites subject
to SSI. Such a list could be subsequently modified (sites removed or added). Alternatively, the
list could remain open – i.e., the sides would be allowed to inspect any site that fits the agreed
criteria for conducting a challenge on-site inspection. Other criteria could include activities such
as the arrival of certain types of railcars or transport trucks.

The sides would need to agree whether the number of SSIs would be limited per year or
unlimited. Existing precedents suggest that limits on the number of SSI may be inversely related
to the intrusiveness of inspections and the availability of means for resolving the issue short of an
on-site inspection. Multilateral agreements (CWC, CTBT) have protections against spurious


inspection requests – such requests are subject to review (approval under CTBT, denial under
CWC) by the executive body. A bilateral US-Russian agreement will not have such protections
to prevent misuse of SSI requests (particularly likely if there is no limit on the number of
inspections) unless the sides can agree on the sites subject to SSIs or to a specific set of criteria
to limit the potential sites that could be subject to SSIs. In order not to undermine the smooth
functioning of the agreement, it may be advisable to allow for a two-stage procedure: the
challenged side would have the right to propose alternative methods of clarifying the situation
(such as provision of additional information) or to grant managed access to protect sensitive data.
The equipment and procedures for this sort of on-site inspection would be contained in the
agreement.

Our menu identifies various options for conducting on-site challenge inspections at declared
suspect sites. Since the characteristics of the handling, transportation, nuclear security, and
storage bunkers of these non-nuclear sites would be defined and agreed through negotiations, the
least intrusive way to conduct such an inspection would be simply for the inspection team to
examine all of the relevant equipment to verify the identified differences and to visually inspect
for evidence of any sensors designated for nuclear warhead handling equipment that are present
with any of the equipment at the site.

Under our closed system approach, which will include frequent analyses of all collected data
(whether further released or not) by the sides and/or using the jointly developed zk-SNARK tool,
the inspection team would not only be looking for warheads on the site. Inspectors would also be
examining all handling, transportation, and nuclear security equipment to differentiate it from
warhead-related equipment and ensure that the host country did not use any of that equipment
within the closed warhead operational system. Since the sensors on the closed system equipment
would record any/all such equipment entering or exiting the closed system, such an inspection
would help confirm that none of the equipment at the suspect site had been used covertly in the
closed system by taking sensors off sanctioned equipment and placing them on non-sanctioned
equipment.

Since some US and Russian nuclear warhead operations are currently being conducted in some
third-party countries, challenge on-site inspections will also have to be applicable to the
territories of third parties. These may include declared and non-declared sites, so suspect site
inspection procedures and equipment would have to be developed and agreed for either type of
site. Declared sites should include at the very least, the NATO sites in US NATO Allies which
participate in nuclear sharing, and Belarus.

The issue of third parties would also require separate agreements between the United States. and
NATO member countries and other countries with a security agreement with the United States
(Japan, South Korea) to allow both on-site spot check visits and suspect-site inspections in their
territories. Presumably, such an agreement would be required between Russia and Belarus as
well. Once agreements with their respective allies are in place, then the US and Russia would
need to agree on any/all countries that may be subject to any kind of suspect site challenge
inspections.


With our closed system approach that targets handling and support equipment, transportation
mechanisms, and nuclear security systems, another way to address suspect sites would be to
apply certain seals and sensors on key equipment at the declared suspect sites. These would be
the same kinds of sensors used on warhead-related operational equipment, but instead of
focusing on producing additional data on warhead operations, equipment at declared non-
warhead sites would be used to provide additional assurances that no warheads have been moved
in or out of those facilities. If the same kind of nuclear detection sensors that were installed at the
entry points to Russian warhead storage sites through CTR cooperation were to be included, they
could be used to validate that no nuclear material passed through such a portal from time of
installation to the time of data collection (direct collection by an inspection team or indirect
collection provided by the host country and transmitted in the form of cryptographically
generated hash codes) or interrogation (by zk-SNARK tool analyses).

Further along these lines the sides could agree on placing similar seals and sensors on bunker
doors that would collect data on dates, time, and duration of openings that could correspond to
the host country taking pictures of loading operations for non-nuclear munitions with dates and
times to enable data collection and validation showing that the bunkers were only open for those
specified non-nuclear operations.

From this menu of suspect site measures and technologies, the sides could negotiate how
extensively they wanted to allow such sensors to be placed on their declared non-nuclear
equipment in exchange for fewer or less frequent challenge inspections. These sensors and the
data collected by them would not likely obviate the need for challenge inspections, but they
could increase confidence and reduce the frequency of such challenge inspections or help the
inspecting team to design their data challenges and challenge inspections.

### Communications................................................................................................................................ F. Data Analysis Centers and a Menu of Applicable Facilities, Hardware, Software, and

### Communications

Until this point in the paper, we have discussed various data collection and analyses functions
but have not identified the methodology for exchanging data or the facilities, hardware, software,
and communications that would be needed for a comprehensive verification protocol addressing
nuclear warheads. In this section we will do so.

Official exchanges of data between the parties, whether in the form of initial declarations, hash
codes, or data challenge results would be transmitted and exchanged in the same manner as with
all current and previous arms control agreements. Those communications and data exchanges are
conducted by the US National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NNRRC) and its Russian
counterpart. NNRRCs can handle a higher capacity of exchanges than are currently conducted,
but if the sides were to agree to an extremely high number of exchanges, the State Department
may require an expansion of its facility, equipment, and personnel.

Based on our analyses and extensive discussions with experts across the arms control
community, we believe that an innovative approach to arms control such as the closed system
application should be implemented in a gradual, step-by-step approach that would be built by the
work of joint technical teams. These teams would negotiate and agree upon the specific measures
and technologies in our initial menu and other suggestions and inputs that may be proposed by
other US and Russian arms control specialists and could then develop the appropriate data
exchanges (and analysis). In this way, the sides would be able to plan and execute any expansion
that may be required.

Depending on the progress and outcome of any step-by-step negotiations, the sides may want to
consider establishing one or more joint facilities to perform specific data functions that would be
required to implement a closed system approach. Such a joint data analysis center should be built
or established at a neutral, third-party location. It would be required to support functions
including data collection, development of one or more zk-SNARK tools, data analyses to be
conducted by zk-SNARK tools, and specified hardware and facilities for generating and
validating cryptographic hash codes.

The more of these functions that the sides agree to implement, the more they should consider co-
developing the hardware that would be designed specifically and exclusively to manage the hash
coding process and other hardware for the databases. Commercial computers could be used to
perform all or some of these functions, but they all have certain operating systems already
installed on them that may pose security risks to both sides. It may be more prudent to design
and develop hardware specifically to perform the exact functions required and nothing else. They
could also be deployed to facilities designed specifically to provide the security to perform just
the functions required.


### Computing on the Closed System Approach Using Cryptography and zk-SNARK Tools........................ G. The Impact of New Technologies Such as Quantum Sensing, Quantum Cryptography, and Quantum

### and Quantum Computing on the Closed System Approach Using Cryptography and zk-

### SNARK Tools

Given that the closed system approach relies heavily on the collection, deciphering, and analyses
of data, concerns may arise regarding the susceptibility of these processes to technological
advances in quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing.

Quantum sensing capabilities are already reaching or will soon enter the commercial
marketplace. These may have applications to confirm the integrity of certain seals and sensors
and we have addressed some of them in our menu and description of the verification regime.

During our demonstration of cryptography in December 2022, we presented and delivered a hash
coding program that combined the preferred American approach to cryptography (AES) and the
Russian-preferred approach (GOST) explaining that even if one side did not trust the other side’s
part of the code, they could rely on their own part of the code to have confidence in the
protections provided by the cryptography to their data.

Quantum computing may be decades away, but during the demonstration there were questions
raised about their impact on cryptography and its use under our closed system verification
regime. To be sure, there are some experts that believe that quantum computers will be too hard
to ever build at a scale that will break current cryptography standards. Current cryptographic
commitments (as hashed declarations representing individual WTS transactions are otherwise
called) can confidently be considered secure against quantum computers. Nonetheless, we would
recommend that the sides employ a step-by-step approach to development where they could
work together to standardize the system, negotiating and pre-planning continuous improvements
in the software – all before building the initial version. Moreover, after the system is deployed,
the sides would need to stay engaged to swap out parts of the program for post-quantum parts as
research advances. If these developments and actions are discussed, understood, and agreed to
upfront, this should not be a problem.

For efficiency reasons, the type of hash function might need to be changed to one that is
specifically created to be efficient in these conditions. What this means is that it would replace
the current one that combines AES (US) and GOST (Russia) so this would add another wrinkle
and layer of discussions to negotiations.

Joint development of software may involve many iterations, including use of red-teaming to
break draft codes before the two sides arrive at a standard both trust. Experts are currently
undertaking similar efforts as they develop post-quantum cryptography. There will have to be an
agreement to build in continuous improvement to address current and post-quantum
cryptography challenges.

This step-by-step development approach should also be employed for the zk-SNARK tools that
the sides may want to include in the verification solution. Joint development should include a
pre-negotiated plan and capability to swap out the zk-SNARK programs for post-quantum
alternatives in the future as needed. The current ones might be prohibitively expensive, but this is


an active area of research that will need to be monitored by experts on both sides. Fully
functioning quantum computers are not a problem yet and they may never become so in reality,
but one needs to prepare for the possibility.

Finally, even if the sides are concerned that quantum computers may pose a future risk to data
that is represented by hash codes, security of the data can be enhanced by using much larger
keys. This is not a preferred solution as it slows down the system. But, if this project were to
target each sides’ entire warhead stockpile, it is an approach that could be considered to increase
confidence in the integrity and security of the verification procedures. The trade-off would entail
additional expense. It is not clear how much additional expense may be acceptable, but this
system for arms control would be used to address a small number of messages per day at the
most – not billions of messages a day as would be required for a commercial solution to be
offered on the internet.

This is yet another reason to consider joint development of hardware that would be solely
dedicated to conducting the required functions of this arms control approach. In fact, it may be
considerably more efficient to build "computers" that can run only the cryptographic and zk-
SNARK programs required to support a closed system approach described in this study. It would
likely operate much faster than commercial computers. We would recommend that the sides
consider jointly creating hardware that transmits the cryptographic hash codes and writes the zk-
SNARK proof.

### Verification H. A Menu of Potential Applications or Uses of the WTS and Closed System Approach to Warhead

### Warhead Verification

The detail and novelty of the verification options proposed in this study suggest that it would be
best to jointly demonstrate the concept and then build technical solutions to support various
possible agreement outcomes using a “graduated” or step-by-step approach to arms control. If
technical teams were allowed to discuss such a system, it could be put in place in a way that
starts with some limited reporting for one type of warhead (nonstrategic, strategic, etc.), or for
one or more sites, and could be expanded over time even if there was no agreement on warhead
limits. The system can be tailored to monitor things like the number of actual deployed warheads
vs. warheads in storage, or it could measure the quantity of an entire inventory and monitor
reductions if they were agreed. With that in mind, we offer a menu of potential agreements that
could begin even with small unilateral proposals that use one or more elements from these
menus.

#### Nuclear Conflict De-escalation and De-confliction

As the Ukraine war wages on, the risk of potential escalation continues to grow. The Russians
have already employed veiled and not so veiled threats of nuclear escalation to deter US and
NATO support for Ukraine. One of the immediate concerns would be the fact that some Russian
warhead storage sites are located within range of current hostilities. Any attack at or near such
facilities, or any warhead operational movements associated with these facilities pose the risk of
misunderstanding that could prompt escalatory actions on either side. Such risks could be
reduced if the sides were to agree to exchange information or notifications on warhead locations


and movements that could employ certain capabilities from our menus, including exchanges of
hash codes on warhead numbers associated with specified sites along with updates provided over
time. At the time of this writing, amid the war in Ukraine, Russia has been far less willing to
provide data on relevant military sites and even ceased implementation of established New
START measures, so the current opportunities for such an agreement would be quite low.

#### Risk Reduction Data Exchanges

Similar to, and building on, the de-escalation and de-confliction type of agreement above, the
system could be used as a risk reduction initiative, designed to provide insight on the total
numbers of warheads in each country. Such information could be broken down into various
categories as the sides build confidence in the advantages of exchanging such numbers. For
example, detailed information could be provided sufficient to specifically track data on certain
warheads correlated by delivery systems. Some data could be issued unilaterally to help initiate
discussions.

The 30 day or more lag in the provision of data would not necessarily provide a tripwire
indicator of plans to deploy or use nuclear weapons, but unusual activity might be detected. If
notifications and data exchanges were to cease, that would be an indicator of activity of concern.

Though some may view them as decreasing the value of deterrence, data exchanges could be
used to bolster deterrence by sharing data on total inventory and capability. By confirming
stockpile data, the credibility of the stockpile and its capability to support a nuclear response
could be enhanced. They could also be used to break down definitions of the total inventory in
terms of deployed, stored, scheduled for dismantlement, etc. This could be very useful to address
nonstrategic warhead concerns and provide transparency.

Even if the system was only used for data exchanges, it would provide benefits in transparency
and improved accountability, bolster deterrence, and demonstrate safe and secure operations.

Data exchanges could be used as a risk reduction measure to help distinguish operations on
safety, security, training, and exercises from deployment and war readiness operations.

Data exchanges could also be used to demonstrate arms control progress to non-nuclear weapon
state parties to the NPT.

#### Site Reductions or Eliminations

The system could be used to implement an agreement to reduce or eliminate warheads at one or
more storage sites. If the sides wanted to reduce or close one or more sites, the system would
provide data to help confirm such activities. This could be extended to include more and more
sites as the sides gain confidence in the reporting and the selected verification methods.

#### Freeze............................................................................................................................................

The system could be used to implement a freeze on overall warhead inventories (as proposed by
the Trump administration and agreed to in principle by Russia) if it included a rigorous
capability to monitor new warheads entering the system and old warheads as they are eliminated.


The freeze could be applied to the entire inventory, a subsection of the inventory such as
deployed or stored, or to one or more sites.

A freeze could be implemented using this system even if the sides do not agree to exchange data
on the actual total quantities in the current inventory.

The focus of the system would be monitoring and tracking passports for warheads as they enter
and exit the system. The two sides would only inspect warheads on site as they are coming in
and out of the closed system. This would be like a virtual portal of production and assembly
sites.

#### Inventory Limits, Caps, or Reductions

The system would require fairly rigorous monitoring and verification measures, in particular
with regard to suspect sites, if the sides were to agree on a mutual cap on warhead inventories.
Caps could be on strategic, nonstrategic, or both. Caps could be on operational warheads only, or
on the entire inventory.

#### Support Mutual Unilateral Reductions

The system could support a unilateral initiative by either side to declare and record specific
reductions or eliminations with the intent to encourage the other side to implement similar
reductions. These could be applied by site, warhead type (strategic or nonstrategic), or warhead
status (operational, deployed, in storage, etc.). For example, the US could use such a system to
provide transparency on the warheads that it indicates are replacing outmoded warheads in
Europe.

The best example of unilateral reductions conducted by the US and Russia is the 1991 - 92
Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNIs) in which both sides pledged to eliminate certain short
range nuclear systems and put all warheads designed for short range systems in central storage.
The initiatives helped achieve huge reductions in the sides’ warhead stockpiles, but without any
verification measures it was hard for either side to be confident that the other’s pledges were
genuine. If such initiatives were combined with non-intrusive data exchanges, however, it may
be possible to reconsider unilateral reductions while providing some insight and confidence in
the actions of the other side.

One side could offer to close one site in exchange for the other to close one of its sites, or a
specific site. For example, it could be used to encourage Russia to remove warheads from
Belgorod for safety and security reasons. It could also be used for Kaliningrad, or even to gain
agreement to prohibit the storage of warheads in Belarus. If Kaliningrad is, in fact, used
occasionally or sparingly for specific purposes or exercises, such a system could be developed or
tailored to provide transparency to NATO on such operations, perhaps in exchange for NATO
providing similar transparency regarding its warhead replacement program.

#### Agreement on Mutually Verifiable Reductions

If the sides were willing to pursue an agreement along the lines of the unilateral measures
described above, then some additional verification measures might be considered. In order to


prepare for such a possibility, even if policymakers are not considering pursuing an agreement at
this time, it would still be helpful for the verification community to consider preliminary steps
using some of the tools and methodologies identified in this menu with the understanding that
the overall system could support verifiable reductions in the future. The closed system approach
could even support such a comprehensive agreement as removing or pulling back warheads to
locations further away from current borders between Russia and NATO countries.

If any of these postulated agreements were to be extended to include China, and perhaps the UK
and France, it may be possible to conceive of an agreement that would seek to increase stability
through a mutual agreement not to store warheads that are fully functional. There could be
various ways to discuss this, starting with something like agreeing not to store fully assembled
warheads. The sides could discuss storage of primary, secondary, and other components in
separate locations. This data exchange process could be used to monitor components using the
same methodology and selecting appropriate verification measures from the menu.

#### An overall Warhead Safeguards-like Agreement

If the sides were willing to discuss allowing mutual monitoring of each other’s inventories, or
partial inventories, safeguards-like measures could be developed from this menu of verification
technologies and processes to monitor warheads during storage. This would mean that data on
handling, support, and even some nuclear security equipment may be exchanged in real, or near-
real time. If it were possible to agree to such real-time exchanges, the sides could characterize
the overall regime as similar in concept to nuclear safeguards, thus establishing a safeguards-like
agreement for warheads. The proposed WTS and its methodology could be used to assist in
monitoring and tracking movements that would greatly assist in regular reporting on the warhead
inventory.

## IV. Conclusion

This study provides an innovative approach to support a potential future agreement or
agreements addressing nuclear warheads. Using the concept of creating unique identifiers for
individual warheads based on their specific service life operations, represented by cryptographic
commitments, and including data challenges, this approach proposes to create a virtual, closed
system of warhead-related operations that can be assessed, validated, and verified by collecting
and analyzing data from a broad array of sensors deployed and installed on warhead handling,
support, transportation, and nuclear security equipment. The sides can reveal data from their
warhead passports to each other through the iterative data challenge process, and that data can in
turn be correlated with the support sensor information they receive during on-site spot check
visits. Together, these features of a comprehensive warhead verification system provide multiple
layers of data that can be examined by remote analyses and on-site collection and inspection
measures.

Rather than providing a prescriptive solution to the challenge of warhead verification, we
provide three related menus that policymakers can draw from to support a step-by-step approach
to negotiations and implementation. The first menu identifies a broad array of arms control


measures and technologies that could be used to establish a closed warhead operational system
for each side, and offers alternative means to both collect, assess, and validate the data associated
with warhead operations. Data from handling, transportation, and nuclear security system
operations can be correlated and corroborated with data from warhead passports to build
confidence and understanding of warhead declarations, operations, and status. The second menu
offers options to address the facilities, hardware, software, and communications requirements to
support such a system, while the third menu identifies a spectrum of potential agreements that
could be supported by some or all elements of the closed system approach using cryptographic
warhead passports.

From these elements and approaches, a warhead verification system could potentially be
developed to address an agreement on nuclear warheads. Such a system can be designed that
would be both effective in developing confidence in the other side's compliance with the
agreement while being less intrusive than the alternative of allowing direct observation of
warheads or even direct collection of data on the composition of warheads. The menus offer
more intrusive options should they be desired as well. Optimally, the sides would negotiate and
design measures jointly under a step-by-step approach that would address the need to protect
sensitive information and reduce intrusiveness while facilitating effective verification that
produces a high level of confidence in the overall system. This methodology would increase the
chances of acceptance of this set of measures and the closed operational system approach. While
no approach can eliminate entirely the risk of spoofing or violations of an agreement, the ability
to double and triple check data through multiple techniques would greatly increase the
challenges and complexity of cheating.

For the most part, we believe a mutually acceptable solution can be designed based mostly on
relatively simple and inexpensive sensors, but these would need to be deployed on a large
quantity of systems. Crucially, more application R&D is required to adapt such simple
commercial systems to meet the tamper-proof and data collection requirements of a closed
system. Based on research we have been able to conduct thus far, this type of application R&D
for these relatively simple sensors is not currently being pursued by either the NNSA or DTRA
arms control R&D programs. It is important to note, however, that there is a long history of R&D
on tamper proof seals that has been conducted by these programs that would contribute to any
further work that may be pursued.

At the same time, the menus presented here are supported by previous arms control and technical
exchange precedents as summarized in Annex B. The closed system approach still utilizes many
traditional elements including:

National technical means (NTM). NTM could be used to support multiple functions such as
observing open displays and technical demonstrations as well as being used to prompt specific
data challenges to validate declared data associated with cryptologically generated warhead
unique identifiers.

Tags, seals, and unique identifiers. These relatively simple sensors are key to establishing the
conceptual closed warhead system approach. The menu developed here does not go into detail on


all the numerous and available devices and technologies available for these types of sensors.
Further application R&D and selection of the most appropriate devices would be highly
dependent on the extent of the agreement and would require joint consideration. Although we did
not offer it in our menu, the sides could also consider the use of “Buddy” tags^7 that would travel
with warheads. These and other non-electronic, non-magnetic, and non-metallic seals and other
physical unique identifiers can work in tandem with our proposed data exchange methodology.

Site diagrams. This approach, like previous arms control treaties, would use site diagrams to
guide on-site inspections and would enable the inspection team to understand the layout of a
particular facility to enhance its confidence with various verification activities. CNS expects that
site diagrams would also be included in a verification protocol addressing warheads. In addition
to its traditional uses, however, CNS envisions that site diagrams may also be used in
conjunction with measures such as pictures and video that may include geo-location and
date/time stamp data to support verification. The sides would need further negotiations to
identify locations within facilities where pictures, videos, and other sensors or data collection
devices may be located.

Pictures, video, and other data to be collected and provided by the host country. Previous arms
control treaties and international agreements such as CTR have used pictures and video to
enhance verification. The menus offered include such measures and identifies some of the
pictures and video that would be useful, when and where they could/should be taken, and how
such data would be gathered, exchanged, and collected in the warhead passport database.
Pictures and video could be considered whether they are provided by the host country, taken
remotely by pre-positioned cameras, or taken by remote controlled robots or robotically
controlled devices. Data may be collected in real time or gathered and shared at later dates.
Locations to be considered would include, for example: storage facilities and specific areas
within the storage facilities; areas within, near, or along rail, air, and sea transfer points used for
transportation of warheads; areas near production/dismantlement facilities where warheads
traverse. Remote sensors, including pictures and video, could also be used as a form of portal
monitoring to be conducted with or without on-site inspectors.

Based on preliminary research conducted by CNS, we know that various organizations are
investigating better ways to use pictures and video for verification purposes. We understand, for
example, that Rob Hughes of the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment is conducting research on
using cryptography to validate photographs and video. In another example, NNSA is conducting
verification R&D on pictures and video capabilities that could be used in a verification protocol
that reduces the previous risks associated with the tampering and spoofing of pictures and video.

updated with each communication between the partners which mitigates the
consequences of a key loss. This effort will study how this algorithm can be adapted to

2) Multilayered Video Authentication for Treaty Inspection a project that SNL was also
contracted to begin in FY22. This project seeks to develop and evaluate an
authenticatable video system for monitoring under a treaty regime. The team is partnering
with a commercial partner, Prometheus Security Group Global, to customize and evaluate
their camera systems in the context of an inspection regime. The project will use several
systems for securing the camera systems: public key cryptography, video steganography
in the raw image, steganography in the compressed image, and direct analog input into
the camera for scene verification. Multiple hardware and software systems will be
considered, a complete system will be built, and the complete system will undergo a
detailed red team evaluation. At the end of the project, a demonstrated and tested system
will be available.
```
On-site inspections. Understanding the need to minimize on-site inspections due to their
intrusiveness, their cost, and the difficulty of negotiating them, we identify a small number of
key locations and associated procedures for on-site inspectors to visit to collect and confirm
warhead passport and sensor data. Given the large number of storage locations in Russia, CNS
recognizes that on-site inspections of all these locations may be costly, would take time, and
would not be very effective except if they were specifically designed to support the validation of
data that has been exchanged or gathered by other means.

Portal monitoring. While our closed system approach does not include deploying permanent
inspectors to monitor activities going in and out of warhead storage sites, or even in and out of
the production facilities, it does perform similar functions to portal monitoring. The key
differences are the use of sensors instead of personnel and the protection of the data until or
unless the sides agree to release it to the other side. CNS does not anticipate that extensive portal
monitoring of warhead storage or production facilities would be acceptable to Russia or the US
due to the extensive manpower and cost involved, and the relatively small value such an activity
may yield. But we do think that the closed system approach could be considered using sensors
and data exchanges.

Given the challenges associated with warhead verification, we believe that our closed system
approach offers a fresh and innovative approach that could be negotiated with Russia and could
provide relatively high confidence verification with minimally intrusive actions.

## ANNEX B. PRECEDENTS

A number of precedents, such as joint initiatives, previous arms control measures, and CTR
experience, are described below, based on their applicability to specific functions and modalities
identified earlier in this paper.

### A. Functional Verification Activities Establishing a Closed Warhead Operational System

A.1. Establishment of a closed warhead operational system to enhance verification.

INF: Locational restrictions in Treaty Article VIII specify that missiles and launchers subject to
the treaty must be located at deployment areas, at support facilities, or in transit.

START I: Restrictions on movements of Road and Rail Mobile launchers of ICBMs outside of
designated areas are described in Article VI. Paragraph 6 of Annex J to the MOU contains
requirements for the site diagrams of the designated areas for such launchers.

New START: The Treaty’s Article IV similarly specifies restrictions on location and transit of
strategic offensive delivery systems, while the Part Four of the NST Protocol further details the
types of movements that must be declared as notifications to the other side under the treaty.

A.2. Portal monitoring – monitoring of virtual portals at storage facilities, rail/air transfer points,
and production/elimination facilities to confirm declarations/notifications or to detect
undeclared warheads.

INF: Continuous portal monitoring was aimed at ensuring that stages of the SS-20 were not
covertly assembled under the guise of the SS-25 ICBM. Both were manufactured at Votkinsk,
but the latter was not subject to the treaty. Section IX of the Protocol on Inspection specifies that
only one rail line and one road within 50 meters of each other shall pass through the portal. All
vehicles capable of containing a portal monitoring-targeted treaty item shall exit only through the
portal, and the no more than two other exits from the site shall be monitored by appropriate
sensors. Weight sensors, vehicle sensors, surveillance systems, vehicle dimensional
measurement equipment, and non-damaging image producing equipment (X-ray) are installed at
the portal. Any shipment that is large enough and heavy enough to contain a relevant treaty item
must be declared. Depending on the declaration, the inspection procedure may include X-ray
imaging and examination of the vehicle interior. Any shipment exiting the portal is subject to
weighing and the measurement of dimensions.

START I: Paragraph 14 of Article XI, Section XVI of the Inspection Protocol and Annex 5 to
that Protocol provide procedures related to the continuous monitoring of production facilities that
may be relevant to the use of sensors on transportation means and portal monitoring of warhead-
related facilities.

New START: The Treaty does not explicitly provide precedents for portal or perimeter
monitoring, particularly because no production facilities may be subject to inspection under the
Treaty. However, it obligates both sides to provide notifications of the exit of solid-fueled


ballistic missiles from their production facilities (NST Protocol, Part Four, Section III.1), as well
as outlines various procedures to confirm the conversion and elimination of strategic arms to no
longer be operable or capable of carrying nuclear weapons (NST Protocol, Part Three).
Depending on monitoring requirements, these procedures, including the use of tamper-proof
seals and tamper-evident equipment, can be adapted for the purposes of the closed system.

Other initiatives: Portal Perimeter Continuous Monitoring (PPCM) was among the Transparency
and Verification Options identified by the Department of Energy Office of Arms Control and
Nonproliferation in 1996. The United States engaged Russia thereafter in the design and
demonstration of portal monitors. Recent activities of Joint US-UK Verification included the
development and demonstration of a Portal Monitor for Arms Control (PMAC). The Nuclear
Disarmament Verification (NuDiVe) 2022 exercise likewise featured the use of portal
monitoring.

### B. Functional Verification Activities Monitoring Containers, Trucks, Railcars, Aircraft

B.1. Monitoring and tracking warhead movements – loading/unloading on railcars, trucks and
possibly aircraft and tracking shipments.

INF: Locational restrictions in Treaty Article VIII specify that missiles and launchers subject to
the treaty must be located at deployment areas, at support facilities, or in transit. Transit shall be
completed within 25 days (Treaty Article VIII.4). Notification must be provided regarding each
transit no later than 48 hours after its completion, including such information as the number of
missiles or launchers that were in transit, the points, dates, and times of departure and arrival,
and the mode of transport (Treaty Article IX.5(f)(i-iii)). Notification must be provided also of the
missile or launcher’s location and time at that location every four days during transit (Treaty
Article IX.5(f)(iv)).

START I: Locations where treaty limited items are permitted must be identified. This could
include parking areas for transportation means. (See Article VI provisions that apply to rail
launchers of ICBMs). Site diagrams and/or geographic coordinates must be provided for all the
locations (See paragraphs 4 to 6 of Annex J to the MOU). Notification must be provided for
movement between locations (See Article VIII and Section II of the Notification Protocol). There
are restrictions on the location of support equipment (transportation means) (see Article IV).
There is a limitation of transit time between locations. (see paragraph 12 of Article IV and
paragraph 10 of Article VI)

New START: The Treaty’s Article IV provides locational restrictions for deployed and non-
deployed delivery vehicles, outlining the types of facilities that those Treaty-Limited Items can
be located at. Per Article IV.4, the transit of non-deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, as well as non-
deployed ICBM launchers cannot exceed 30 days. The NST Protocol’s Part Four, Section III lists
notifications of specific types of movements, including exits of solid-fueled missiles from
production facilities and heavy bombers’ visits to areas outside of national territories that last for
longer than 24 hours. Moreover, Type Two inspections (outlined by the NST Protocol’s Part
Five, Section VII.8) can be used to verify empty launch canisters, providing a precedent for


inspecting empty rail cars, trucks, and other transport means for nuclear warheads. Additionally,
in the presence of numerous containers in transit, procedures for inspecting containers declared
to be non-nuclear can be drawn from New START’s reentry vehicle inspection procedures,
outlined in NST Protocol’s Annex on Inspection Activities, Part Six, Section II.

Other initiatives: Abovementioned technical solutions for portal monitoring may apply.

### C. Functional Verification Activities: On-Site Visit/Challenges at Declared Facilities

C.1. Challenge inspection of a warhead transport truck/railcar secure storage/parking area,
including inspections of randomly selected trucks or railcars to gather data on their mileage and
movements recorded and to confirm the absence of warheads.

INF: The Protocol on Inspection Section VII.7 grants inspectors the right to inspect the interior
of all vehicles at the inspection site “whose dimensions are equal to or greater than the
dimensions specified” for treaty items. Such vehicles may be inspected at any time during an
inspection, and no such vehicle shall leave the site or building under inspection until inspected at
the exit (Protocol on Inspection Section VII.12-13).

START I: Under Annex I to the Inspection Protocol, inspectors have the right to confirm the
numbers, and, if applicable, types, variants or versions of items of inspection that are specified
for the facility to be inspected and declared for the inspection site and to confirm the absence of
any other item of inspection at the inspection site. This Annex also provides procedures for the
inspection of covered objects, containers, launch canisters, vehicles, and structures located at that
site.

New START: Per NST Protocol’s Part Five, Section VII.8, Type Two inspections give the
inspecting party the right to confirm that all launch canisters within the boundaries of an
inspection site that were declared to be empty are, in fact, empty. This provides a precedent for
confirming that all declared empty trucks and railcars are, in fact, empty. Possible facilities that
can be designated for Type Two inspections include loading and storage facilities for ICBMs and
SLBMs, as well as their repair facilities, and this precedent can similarly be applied to support
transport facilities under the closed system.

C.2. Challenge inspection of a container storage site or storage facility confirming the absence of
warheads.

INF: According to the protocol for baseline, close-out, and short-notice inspections, a container
that is declared to contain a treaty item and that is not sufficiently large to contain more than one
treaty item is inspected via external observation and measurement of dimensions only (Protocol
on Inspection Section VII.8). So is a structure or container not sufficiently large to contain a
treaty item (Protocol on Inspection Section VII.9). A container that is declared not to contain a
treaty item but is sufficiently large to contain one is inspected by weighing or interior
observation, unless it is a launch canister containing an item not subject to the treaty, in which
case it is inspected via external visual observation, linear measurement, and radiation detection
(Protocol on Inspection Section VII.8). A space that is declared not to contain a treaty item but is


sufficiently large to contain such an item is not subject to inspection if it is shown not to be
accessible by the smallest treaty item or if a visual inspection of the interior from the entrance
shows it does not contain a treaty item (Protocol on Inspection Section VII.10). During
inspections of former bases and facilities, the burden is on the inspected party to demonstrate that
a shrouded object larger than the smallest treaty item is not a treaty item, through partial shroud
removal, measuring, weighing, or other methods (Protocol on Inspection Section VII.14).

START I: Under Annex I to the Inspection Protocol, inspectors have the right to confirm the
numbers, and, if applicable, types, variants or versions of items of inspection that are specified
for the facility to be inspected and declared for the inspection site and to confirm the absence of
any other item of inspection at the inspection site. This Annex also provides procedures for the
inspection of covered objects, containers, launch canisters, vehicles, and structures located at that
site.

New START: Part Nine of the Annex on Inspection Activities outlines specific procedures for
inspecting objects, covered objects, containers, vehicles, and structures. At each kind of base
eligible for inspection, this part provides specific measurements that a given structure or object
would need to exceed in order to be capable of containing a TLI (Annex on Inspection Activities,
Part Nine.3). The same approach could be adapted to determine which structures could
potentially contain warhead containers, thereafter designating them as eligible for confirming the
absence of warheads within.

### D. Functional Verification Activities: Displays and Close-Outs

D.1. Close-out inspections.

CTR: US visits to former warhead sites in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia established contracts
with local construction companies to bulldoze or blow up former bunker facilities and cover the
facilities with rock and then concrete.

INF: Close-out inspections are covered under paragraph 4 of Article XI of the Treaty. The
Protocol on Inspection Section VII.7 allows inspectors to “inspect the entire inspection site,
including the interior of structures, containers or vehicles, or including covered objects, whose
dimensions are equal to or greater than the dimensions specified.” Support structures are
eliminated in situ (Treaty Article X.4), and support equipment is removed, subject to verification
by inspections.

START I: Close-out inspection procedures are covered under paragraph 9 of Article XI and
Section XII of the Inspection Protocol. These procedures may be relevant in determining whether
a warhead storage facility, rail/road transfer point, or other associated sites have been closed out
and therefore warheads are no longer permitted to be present there. Formerly declared facility
inspection procedures are covered under paragraph 10 of Article XI and Section XIII of the
Inspection Protocol and may be relevant in determining whether any warhead-related activity is
being conducted there.


New START: While the New START Treaty does not provide a category of close-out
inspections specifically, the Treaty’s Article XI.3 and the NST Protocol’s Part Five, Section VII
outline procedures for Type Two inspections of formerly declared facilities to verify that they are
not being used for “purposes inconsistent with the Treaty.” That includes inspecting facilities
that have been converted to no longer house nuclear weapons and verifying the absence of those
weapons by inspecting those facilities and individual delivery systems within them via a
sampling approach, detailed in NST Protocol: Annex on Inspection Activities, Part Seven.

Other initiatives and precedents: Several international research initiatives (including IPNDV and
UNIDIR-led efforts) have studied the applicability of gamma and neutron imaging techniques, as
well as other on-site inspection procedures to the process for verifying the absence of nuclear
warheads and material at a given facility. For instance, these initiatives also outlined use cases
for tamper-evident seals, cameras, and cryptographic algorithms for authenticating the collected
data and software of the devices used. Cryptographic authentication was also employed during
implementation of the Open Skies Treaty.

D.2. Open display of warhead or container – performed in association with a transfer of custody
at the beginning or end of a transportation shipment or performed randomly at negotiated times
and frequency at or near a storage facility. This would be used to confirm
declarations/notifications. The displays would be another entry into the warhead passports and
could be correlated later through a data challenge.

INF: Continuous portal monitoring procedures provide for the opening of containers without
removal of the item from the container to ensure that the item is, as declared, not an item subject
to the treaty. In addition, cooperative measures provide for the removal of concealment and
display of missiles and launchers in the open at the inspecting party’s request to allow for
verification via national technical means (Treaty Article XII).

START I: Displays in the open may be necessary to substitute for on-site inspections under
certain circumstances, such as demonstrating that a warhead container, truck or railcar was
empty. (See Article XII).

New START: In case of the ICBM, SLBM, and heavy bomber elimination, the NST Protocol’s
Part Three, Section II.3 allows for the use of National Technical Means to observe the eliminated
missiles, bombers, and launch canisters for 60-day periods following the notification of its
elimination. With these items required to be “visible to the national technical means of
verification” for the entirety of the aforementioned period, the Treaty sets the precedent for
similar language in relation to open displays of warhead containers.


D.3. Technical characteristics exhibition – exhibition of warheads/warhead containers, trucks,
and railcars to facilitate confirmation of declarations/notifications, for example, at truck or railcar
storage facilities by pulling out randomly selected railcar trays to show there are no warheads in
the stored areas. This could be similar to open displays, but focused on the handling and
transport systems for nuclear warheads.

INF: Data exchanges involved an initial declaration of the technical characteristics (including
length, maximum diameter, height, and weight) of treaty items including missiles, launchers,
support structures, and support equipment. The information was verified by one American and
one Soviet team conducting independent measurements of the items in question at elimination
sites. The measurements were taken as the standard for all subsequent inspections. In addition,
the INF Treaty provided for the examination of inspection equipment and supplies by the in-
country escort in the presence of the inspection team (Protocol on Inspection Section V.4).

START I: Technical characteristic exhibitions may be necessary to confirm the size and
configuration of warheads and transportation means that may be observed during inspections or
in displays in the open. (See paragraph 11 of Article XI and Section XIV of the Inspection
Protocol.)

New START: Article XI.4 of the Treaty obliges both Parties to conduct exhibitions to the other
party in order to demonstrate features and technical characteristics of new types of TLIs, as well
as to demonstrate the results of conversation of the first item of each TLI type. Annex on
Inspection Activities, Part Eight.3 lays out further details for exhibition procedures, enabling the
inspecting party to make measurements of the exhibited items and record distinguishing features
and technical data related to the item in accordance with regular inspection procedures. This
approach could be similarly employed to conduct exhibitions for new types of warheads,
containers, trucks, and railcars introduced into the closed system’s monitoring regime.

### E. Functional Verification Activities: Suspect Site Inspections

E.1. Suspect site challenge inspection at declared conventional warhead storage site, at a site not
declared to contain either conventional or nuclear warheads.

INF: The treaty does not provide for inspections at undeclared or suspect sites, although the
procedure for short-notice inspections, particularly inspections of former missile operating bases
and support facilities, may offer reference.

START I: Suspect site inspections are covered under paragraph 5 of Article XI; the specific sites
to be subject to such inspections would be agreed by the parties in advance.

New START: The treaty does not specify suspect-site inspections, but procedures for Type Two
inspections at formerly declared facilities may offer relevant techniques and technologies for this
function. Specifically, FDFs are declared to no longer have the capability for storing nuclear
weapons, e.g. on heavy bombers, and the NST Protocol’s Part Five and Annex on Inspection
Activities, Part Seven outline the procedures that can be transferred to suspect-site inspections.


UK-Norway Initiative: Initiative participants explored managed access techniques including
identity checks, searches, shrouding, exclusion zones, walkways, limits on time and the number
of inspectors, escorting and monitoring, among others, to avoid interfering with facility
operations and protect sensitive objects and information. While the scenario of the exercise is the
verification of warhead dismantlement, the managed access procedures developed by the
initiative are applicable to any challenge inspection, particularly at suspect sites, where the
inspected party is likely to have concerns related to the protection of sensitive information.

Joint US-UK Verification: Like the UK-Norway Initiative, Joint US-UK Verification sought to
develop and demonstrate verification technologies and managed access procedures that protect
sensitive information while complying with the inspected facility’s safety and security
requirements.
